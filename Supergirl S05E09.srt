1
00:00:01,958 --> 00:00:04,091
In the beginning,
there was only one.

2
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:06,745
A single black infinitude.

3
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:11,054
Then the infinitude
found release,

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:15,798
and, finally,
the darkness broke,
filling it with life...

5
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:25,634
With the multi-verse.

6
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:29,594
Every existence multiplied
by possibility.

7
00:00:29,638 --> 00:00:34,251
And spread out before
space and time
in infinite measure.

8
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,601
Civilizations rose and fell.

9
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:40,736
And rose again across
reality's grasping expanse.

10
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:45,349
Life. A precious gift
persevering in the face
of every obstacle,

11
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:49,266
until, finally, the age
of heroes was born.

12
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:53,575
Chaos. The constant
enemy of life

13
00:00:53,618 --> 00:00:57,274
kept at bay by champions from across the multi-verse...

14
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:26,129
...joining forces to fight
on behalf of all creation.

15
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:29,480
They found each other
just in time,

16
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:33,615
because now,
the entire multi-verse is about to come under attack.

17
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,010
There is a malevolent force
at work,

18
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:40,274
one driven by a singular goal.

19
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:43,103
I hope you're watching,
big guy.

20
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,283
The destruction
of all there is.

21
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:56,855
I have planned,

22
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,815
there are those who say
I have schemed,

23
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:04,559
but the time for preparation
has passed.

24
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:09,172
The Crisis is now upon us all.

25
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:12,088
Holy crimson skies of death!

26
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:25,319
The end of the world
is licking at our heels!

27
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,799
Soon, thou shall be not
but dust,

28
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:31,977
twisting and writhing
in the dead of space!

29
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:35,416
-Not even Supergirl
will save you from...

30
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,222
Guess Supergirl was able
to save you.

31
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,529
Now, go! Run!

32
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,489
Hey, Spike! Remember me?

33
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,318
Ilana's worried about you.

34
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:11,016
She knows you're afraid
of something,

35
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,845
-but she just wants you
to come home.

36
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,283
Come here.

37
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,081
What's got
you so spooked, buddy?

38
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:42,309
Every pet in National City
is having a nervous breakdown.

39
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,485
This feels bigger
than Leviathan.

40
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,704
The USGS didn't register
an early warning,

41
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,576
-so it took everyone
completely by surprise.

42
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,274
She does mean everyone
because this earthquake

43
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,971
is quite, literally, worldwide.

44
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:55,191
But the seismic activity wasn't
coming from within the planet,

45
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,280
it's coming from without.

46
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,542
-That's--
-Extra-normal.

47
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,501
I was gonna say "impossible,"
but okay.

48
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,807
Yes, yes, a fair descriptor.
As would be, uh...

49
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:05,462
"unfeasible, unthinkable,
absurd, outlandish."

50
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:06,724
But however you choose
to describe this event,

51
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:08,422
one thing
is absolutely certain.

52
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,033
-We have--
-A major crisis on our hands.

53
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:17,257
The Monitor freed Mal?
I didn't know he was
of this universe.

54
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,781
Yes, I thought the Monitor
was a Flash and Green Arrow's
problem.

55
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,739
He's of every universe
and everyone's problem.

56
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,872
Last year, he tested Kara
and Earth-1's heroes

57
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,527
with Dr. Deegan
and the Book of Destiny.

58
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:29,312
This year, he's testing me
to make sure
I'm ready for this.

59
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,487
And what exactly is this?

60
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:32,228
-Another reality wave?
-Not exactly.

61
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:37,364
Whatever is it, it is
hurtling through space
at an impossible speed.

62
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,715
I calculate it will reach
the edge of the universe
in exactly 5.3 hours,

63
00:04:40,758 --> 00:04:42,020
at which point,
it will boomerang back.

64
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:44,501
Once it intersects again
with our solar system,

65
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:49,332
the results will be,
in a word, cataclysmic.

66
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:51,334
Exactly when will it reach us?

67
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:53,031
There are too many variables
to calculate precisely,
but I will say this.

68
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:55,730
If this wave isn't stopped
by tomorrow night...

69
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:56,861
there will be no more us...

70
00:04:56,905 --> 00:05:00,822
no more future...
no more anything.

71
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:05,522
Are there any
inhabited planets
in its trajectory?

72
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,784
-Just one.

73
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:11,485
Argo City.

74
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,400
-Oh, my God. Superman's there
with Lois and...
-My mom.

75
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,140
Can we warn them?

76
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:17,360
Argo Harun-El sure makes
communication difficult,
but I will try.

77
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:19,971
-How much time
do they have, Brainy?
-Not enough.

78
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,367
Superman,
champion of Earth,

79
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,543
who faced off with Doomsday,

80
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,371
apprehended General Zod,

81
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,590
and went toe-to-toe

82
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,332
with dozens of Lex Luthor's
death traps,

83
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,203
has finally met his match.

84
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,640
-A dirty diaper.

85
00:05:36,684 --> 00:05:38,947
What do you think?
Front page news?

86
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,775
Uh... I mean, I think
it's a little lowbrow

87
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:43,255
-for Lois Lane.
-Lowbrow?

88
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,822
If only the citizens of Earth

89
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:47,651
could see Kal-El
struggling with spit up.

90
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:50,045
Need I remind you, Miss Lane,

91
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:51,525
uh, I have no powers here.

92
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,614
Oh, don't you be blaming this
on the red sun, honey.

93
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,790
Hey, buddy.

94
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,966
-Yay, Daddy did it.
-Yeah, kinda.

95
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:02,666
Jonathan really
has your eyes, huh?

96
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,407
I'll take it...

97
00:06:04,451 --> 00:06:06,627
so long he has
your everything else.

98
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:10,805
You know, when I used
to picture us together,

99
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,502
we were always
living on Earth,

100
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:14,504
and we had two kids.

101
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:17,551
Well, I hate to break it
to you, Kansas,

102
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:18,769
but prognostication

103
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,510
is not one of your superpowers.

104
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,338
Oh...

105
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:26,516
Kal, Lois...

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,431
Kara? In pants?

107
00:06:30,346 --> 00:06:31,565
How did she manage
to break through

108
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:32,609
Argo's shield interference?

109
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,611
Not well, apparently.

110
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,310
Kal, Lois... Argo is in danger.

111
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,008
You need to get out now!

112
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:55,066
Alura!

113
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,286
Kal, Lois, thank God.

114
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,418
What's happening?

115
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,549
A massive energy
is moving through space.

116
00:06:59,593 --> 00:07:00,985
It's killing everything
in its path.

117
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,944
-How long do we have?
-Minutes!

118
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,467
Quickly! With me!

119
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,732
We must set a course for Earth.

120
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:09,864
Hopefully, they'll have
enough time

121
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,170
to stop this wave
before it hits.

122
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,870
- Where are the rest?

123
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:18,176
There are no others.
Only this one.

124
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,098
We'll always
be with you, Jonathan.

125
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:29,492
We will never leave you.

126
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,059
Even in the face of our deaths.

127
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,235
We love you.

128
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,094
They're gone.

129
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,279
And we're next.

130
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:26,941
For a very long time,
I have hated this place.

131
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:30,248
I think about all the people
that it took from me.

132
00:08:30,292 --> 00:08:33,556
It would just...
It would just make me
so angry.

133
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:36,777
But you're not now.

134
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,430
I'm still a little bit angry.

135
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:43,261
This island taught me
to survive.

136
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,613
It turned me into someone else.

137
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,485
Somebody better than
the person I was before.

138
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:55,796
So, despite my feelings...

139
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:01,323
there are no stories
about the Green Arrow to tell

140
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,327
if I don't make my way
to Lian Yu.

141
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,330
And I'm also not standing,
at this moment...

142
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,115
looking at my daughter.

143
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,641
Thank you for letting me
be a part of your story.

144
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:18,906
Even if it was only
for a little while.

145
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:24,085
Yeah, something tells me
you're gonna create
your own stories.

146
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:40,275
Lyla.

147
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,406
The Crisis has begun.

148
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,063
Cisco,
what have you got?

149
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:49,153
Is this an isolated event?
Is it everywhere?

150
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,068
-Cisco?

151
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:52,200
Iris!

152
00:09:58,119 --> 00:10:00,687
-Lyla?
-I'm Harbinger now.

153
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:03,515
I'm working with the Monitor.

154
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,693
He sent you to get me?

155
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,086
-Because the Crisis is here?
-That is correct.

156
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:12,873
I'm ready.

157
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:19,401
Turning our
attention to local news,

158
00:10:19,444 --> 00:10:22,752
a series of robberies
by the Wonderland Gang
continues

159
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:26,060
with seemingly no end
in sight...

160
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:32,283
Where is Alice?

161
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,880
-I said, "Where is Alice?"

162
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:06,230
Okay... okay, I'll tell you.

163
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:10,017
-There's an old sugar factory.
-Where is it?

164
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,199
Batwoman, the multi-verse
is in great danger.
You are needed.

165
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,983
I'll deal with,
whatever your crazy is,
in a minute.

166
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,681
There is no more time.

167
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:30,690
Okay, folks, time for
our tie-breaker question
of the night. Here we go.

168
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:34,694
What is the name
of the last song
Janis Joplin ever recorded?

169
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,608
Ready for some free drinks?

170
00:11:36,652 --> 00:11:40,482
And the answer to our final
bonus question is...

171
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:41,744
"Little Robot Man."

172
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:43,920
The strange visitors
are the winners tonight.

173
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,008
Better luck next time, legends.

174
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,662
Uh, no, that's wrong.

175
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,186
But "Mercedes Benz"
was Janis Joplin's last song.

176
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,275
I'm gonna tell
that trivia host.

177
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:52,407
Sara.

178
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,583
So, you remember
last year at Woodstock

179
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:57,586
when I was supposed to steal
a lock of Janis Joplin's hair
without her noticing?

180
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,241
-Yeah?
-Uh, she noticed.

181
00:12:00,284 --> 00:12:03,287
-Then she called me--
-"Little Robot Man."

182
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,942
Well, congratulations,
you change history

183
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,988
and lost us trivia night.

184
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,775
Oh, and we're done here.

185
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,561
Lyla? What's with the suit?

186
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:18,955
Panic is rising out there.

187
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,957
I want every available agent
in the field

188
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,177
until we get a handle
on whatever this thing is.

189
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,490
Hey! Face down
on the floor. Now!

190
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:35,755
Did you do this?
Did you destroy Argo?

191
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,894
Oh, my God, you're okay.

192
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,723
Thanks to her. She appeared
at the last second
and brought us here.

193
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,683
We sent Jonathan off
in an escape pod.

194
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,251
And my mother?

195
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:57,646
I'm so sorry, Kara.

196
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:03,957
Kara?

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,697
Where are we?
And what just happened?

198
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,525
-Um--
-You're on Earth-38.

199
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,180
-There was--

200
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,922
That rabbit was about to talk.

201
00:13:12,966 --> 00:13:15,011
This one speaks to rabbits.

202
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:18,101
It's okay. 'Cause we're all
on the same side.

203
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:20,538
Are we?
'Cause I don't know them.

204
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:22,105
But you know me.

205
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,107
And if you were brought here
with all these other heroes,

206
00:13:24,151 --> 00:13:26,153
it's probably because
we need you.

207
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,633
I trust everyone
in this room
with my life.

208
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,461
Including you.

209
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:40,428
Well, I guess you should all
just call me Kate.

210
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:43,431
Yeah, yeah, that makes
a lot of sense.

211
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,827
Uh, I'm Mia.
I'm Oliver's daughter.

212
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,437
I never knew he had a daughter.

213
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,612
He gets that a lot.

214
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:51,831
Hmm...

215
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:54,529
Okay, you. Start talking.

216
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:58,838
There's a wave
of anti-matter sweeping
across this universe,

217
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:00,578
destroying everything
in its path.

218
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:02,798
I've seen the anti-matter wave
in action.

219
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,149
It wiped all of Earth-2
right out of existence.

220
00:14:06,193 --> 00:14:08,456
I brought you all
to Earth-38 because
this is where

221
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,414
the Monitor wants you
to make your stand.

222
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,416
This universe
is the tipping point.

223
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,332
If we don't stop
the anti-matter wave here,

224
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,944
it will continue
to the next universe,

225
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:20,598
and the next, and the next.

226
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:25,952
Until it has obliterated,
not only every Earth,
but every thing...

227
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,301
across all reality.

228
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,651
Right. So, we are going to
need a bigger team.

229
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,567
Where's Barry?
Where are the legends?

230
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,047
Doing reconnaissance.

231
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,875
I'm headed
to check on them now.

232
00:14:39,182 --> 00:14:40,357
I still don't like her.

233
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:42,098
Well, Brainy's algorithm
will help forecast

234
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:45,101
exactly how much time we have
until the anti-matter wave
hits.

235
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:46,494
Thank you all for being here.

236
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,800
I know we can
beat this together.

237
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,759
About Jonathan...

238
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:53,980
we set a course for Earth
in his pod, but we don't know
where it landed.

239
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,938
Or even if it landed.

240
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,636
Brainy, can you track
his trajectory?

241
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,029
Absolutely.

242
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:02,031
We'll find that bouncing bundle
of Kryptonian joy

243
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,294
-faster than
a flying Flackurian--

244
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,135
This is a new problem.

245
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:20,354
I can handle it.

246
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,445
Wait, the tower
isn't a threat.

247
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:25,968
How do you know?

248
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,709
It's a quantum tower,
apparently.

249
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,538
And it's the only thing
that can save the people
of this world.

250
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:38,241
At the dawn of time,

251
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,896
the Monitor placed
quantum towers
on key Earths

252
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,333
as a last line of defense.

253
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,683
The red skies are dissipating,
which means it's working.

254
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:47,598
From this design,
it looks like
the tower is capable

255
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:49,774
of generating
a quantum flux field,

256
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:53,256
-which can, theoretically--
-Reverse the exogenic state
of the anti-matter wave,

257
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,476
thereby dissipating
the anti-matter energy.

258
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes. Finally, someone
who speaks my language.

259
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,393
Love your suit.

260
00:15:59,436 --> 00:16:01,612
If you want, I can probably
give it an upgrade.

261
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,005
Depends on how attached you are
to your hand.

262
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,615
Pretty attached.

263
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,574
So the tower can stop
this Earth from
being destroyed?

264
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,792
If you can protect it.

265
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:10,273
-Protect it from what?
-The Anti-Monitor.

266
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:13,102
He commands forces
greater than any army.

267
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:15,148
When the tower stops the wave,

268
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:19,543
they will come to thwart
any effort to save this planet
and its people.

269
00:16:19,587 --> 00:16:21,502
Sprock!

270
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:24,461
Jonathan's pod
has disappeared
from our radar.

271
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,463
It appears to have been
sucked into a wormhole.

272
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,031
-What are the co-ordinates?
-Star City. Earth-16.

273
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:30,815
Interesting.

274
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:34,254
It must've been
a temporal wormhole because...

275
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:37,300
well, the pod
is in the year 2046.

276
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,823
We've been there before.

277
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,651
Apparently, we didn't
just travel to the future.

278
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:44,133
Yeah, we traveled
to a parallel Earth
in the future. That's great.

279
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:46,788
-I'm going after him.
-Clark, you can't.

280
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:50,096
Those are two words
I'm not used to hearing
and my son needs me.

281
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:52,272
I'm a parent and I get it.

282
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,276
The entire universe needs you.

283
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:58,017
When that tower gets attacked,

284
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,670
you have to be here
to protect it.

285
00:16:59,714 --> 00:17:01,585
I'll go.

286
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,022
Lois...

287
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:04,458
I'll back you up.

288
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,590
-I know the terrain.
- As will I.

289
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:09,028
I happen to be excellent
with children.

290
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,988
Don't worry, I'll get him.

291
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:14,685
I love you.

292
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:17,645
You know, Oliver...

293
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,256
I've seen playboy Oliver,

294
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,910
vigilante Oliver,

295
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,869
but I never thought
I would see parent Oliver.

296
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:28,264
-It's weird, right?
-So weird.

297
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,266
But... it looks good on you.

298
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:36,968
Uh, J'onn, I thought
Director Danvers was with you.

299
00:17:37,012 --> 00:17:38,796
She was.

300
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,320
But she went to call
the president to co-ordinate
the evacuation,

301
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:42,191
in case
the quantum tower fails.

302
00:17:42,235 --> 00:17:44,759
She is smart, that is exactly
what I was about to suggest,

303
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,761
but has she contemplated
the number of ships

304
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,806
one would require
for such an exodus?

305
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,115
Brainy, every alien refugee
on this planet came here
on a ship.

306
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,899
I intend to ask them
for their help.

307
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:56,727
Do you really think they will?

308
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,599
After how the government
treated them last year.

309
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:02,168
I have faith that...
everybody will do
the right thing.

310
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:04,213
Humans and aliens alike.

311
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,172
Well, in any event...

312
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:08,130
this should help.

313
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,530
Oh, Sprock.

314
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:20,186
I just managed
to zero in on Jonathan's
location in Star City.

315
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,803
The president is in.
He's speaking
with other world leaders.

316
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:31,197
We'll co-ordinate
the effort from National City.

317
00:18:31,806 --> 00:18:33,416
But J'onn...

318
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,115
even if we did manage
to get enough ships
for everyone,

319
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:38,160
we can't just fly off Earth.

320
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,207
I mean, space itself
is being erased.

321
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,166
Earth-1 is the last stop
on the anti-matter trajectory.

322
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,255
We can try
and get everybody there.

323
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,997
Well, one little extrapolator
is not gonna do the job.

324
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,304
The transmatter portal?

325
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:53,175
Who could build one big enough?

326
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,655
I mean, not even Brainy has.

327
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:56,787
Lena.

328
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:58,833
She built an enormous one
for the daxamites.

329
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:01,357
-I'm sure she could
build one twice as big.
-No, that's too big of a risk.

330
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:04,317
I mean, after Myriad,
after everything...

331
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,145
she can't be trusted.

332
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,842
What other choice do we have?

333
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,902
I'm sorry about your mom.

334
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:28,819
I couldn't save her.

335
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:32,127
You had no powers on Argo.
There was nothing you could do.

336
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,650
I feel like a fool.

337
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:36,218
I thought I could
give up the cape and just...

338
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,221
have everything
I ever wanted.

339
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,399
And now, Argo is gone,

340
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,574
this Earth is in danger,

341
00:19:44,618 --> 00:19:46,620
Lois and Jonathan
are out in the universe,

342
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:48,535
where I can't protect them.

343
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,408
And part of me can't help
thinking that...

344
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:57,674
that I deserve this...

345
00:19:57,718 --> 00:20:00,155
for thinking that
I could have so much.

346
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:04,638
That anyone could.

347
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:08,990
I get it.

348
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,559
I've been thinking that
a lot, too, lately.

349
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,517
How I can never do enough.

350
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,305
How my mistakes outweigh
all the good I've ever done.

351
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,745
But it's not true.

352
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:27,661
It can't be.

353
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,403
And we're going to save them.

354
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:34,058
Lois, Jonathan,
this whole planet.

355
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:37,323
We've done it a dozen times
and we're going to do it again.

356
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:41,544
How are you so...
hopeful right now?

357
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:43,938
You've lost
just as much as I have today.

358
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:46,157
Argo, your mom...

359
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:51,728
Before our parents
sent us to Earth...

360
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,818
nobody here knew
about Krypton.

361
00:20:56,472 --> 00:21:01,390
Now, there are stories,
celebrations,
museum exhibits.

362
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:05,351
Just like you shared
our home with your family,

363
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:07,962
we shared our home
with this whole world.

364
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:13,359
Krypton's not just a place,
it's a spirit.

365
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:18,102
It's hope. It's sacrifice.

366
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:23,107
It's what our parents
did for us.

367
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,763
What you did for Jonathan.

368
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:31,725
We have made our parents proud
by fighting for what's right.

369
00:21:34,554 --> 00:21:36,556
So, we have to keep fighting.

370
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,341
And as long as
that spirit is alive,

371
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,343
Krypton will never die.

372
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:55,444
-You wanted to see me?
-I did.

373
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:56,924
I have something for you.

374
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,231
What is it?

375
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,494
Only one way to find out.

376
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,456
Okay, please tell me
you're planning on
wearing this.

377
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,721
I don't think that
that one would fit me.

378
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,117
There should always be
at least one Green Arrow.

379
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,294
Dad, I can't.

380
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,818
You know, Mia, the Monitor
has taken a lot from me.

381
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:27,041
But I will always
be grateful for the time
he has given me with you.

382
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,522
If you're not gonna wear this,
no one should.

383
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:30,784
You earned it.

384
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,529
Just try it on, okay?
I gotta find Barry.

385
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:45,712
The fastest man alive
shows up late to the Crisis
we've been expecting for years.

386
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:48,105
-Ugh...
-It's not the...
it's not the best look, Barry.

387
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:50,543
Lyla had us doing some recon
of the quantum towers.

388
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:54,285
But listen, do you remember
the newspaper article
I showed you on the time vault?

389
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,026
Red skies and a "crisis"?

390
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,814
Okay, well, the Monitor
confirmed the papers
had lied and...

391
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,992
in this Crisis,
I'm supposed to die.

392
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,515
-No.
-No?

393
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,125
We need to talk. Now!

394
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:09,910
Who're you talking to?

395
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,302
Hey, right now!

396
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,703
We are past the time
for discussion, Oliver.

397
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,705
You and I had an agreement.

398
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,404
I die.

399
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:28,668
Barry and Kara live!

400
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:31,497
Yes... to keep
the cosmic balance.

401
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,936
So, why are you telling Barry
that he's gonna die?

402
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:40,462
I spared your friends' lives
so they could save
their world last year.

403
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:44,727
This... is a very
different threat.

404
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,121
You need to
stop playing games with me.

405
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:50,037
You tell me
why the Anti-Monitor
is doing this.

406
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:55,129
And then tell me
how I'm going to prevent it.

407
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,044
Not knowing
what you're fighting means

408
00:23:57,087 --> 00:24:00,090
you will prepare
for every possibility.

409
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:02,353
Because this threat
brings with it

410
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,052
the annihilation of all life

411
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,706
in all realities.

412
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,840
Do you now comprehend
the scope...

413
00:24:10,884 --> 00:24:13,582
of the danger we all now face?

414
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,035
Are you here to arrest me
during the apocalypse,

415
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,777
or to try and kill me
because you weren't successful
the other day?

416
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,127
I wasn't trying
to hurt you, Lena.

417
00:24:37,171 --> 00:24:39,129
I was trying to stop you
from using Myriad.

418
00:24:39,173 --> 00:24:42,829
Right. Is that why you had
a Claymore satellite
aimed at me?

419
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:45,005
And I didn't use Myriad,
that was Eve Tessmacher.

420
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,268
You and I both know
that that isn't true.

421
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:53,013
The reason the sky is red,
and the planet feels like
it's falling apart

422
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,102
is because it is.

423
00:24:55,145 --> 00:24:57,017
There is an anti-matter wave
that is tearing through
the universe right now,

424
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,108
and it will destroy Earth
if Kara and the other heroes
don't stop it.

425
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:04,720
Now, I am working with J'onn
to hedge our bets
and mount an evacuation,

426
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,374
but in order to do that...

427
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:08,637
we need your help.

428
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:12,119
Look, I am sorry
that I lied to you.

429
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:15,470
And not just me,
and not just Kara...

430
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,212
it was all of us.

431
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:22,172
J'onn and Brainy and Nia.

432
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,740
You know, you actually
had me believe
that you hated Supergirl.

433
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,568
I wasn't pretending about that.

434
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,832
And that is a... long story.

435
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:35,011
Listen, I-- I know
that you feel burned by us.

436
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,665
And that there is nothing
that I can say

437
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:39,363
in this moment
that is going to change that.

438
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:44,412
But if you could please
just put your feelings aside,

439
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:48,329
J'onn and I really, really,
need your help.

440
00:25:59,645 --> 00:26:02,082
I don't want
your apology, Alex.

441
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,693
'Cause you will never again
have my friendship or my trust.

442
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:06,608
I have learned my lesson
from all of you.

443
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:10,743
But if the world is at stake,
then of course, I'll help.

444
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,788
It is hubris of you
to think that I wouldn't,

445
00:26:12,832 --> 00:26:15,269
but then, you've made it
perfectly clear

446
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:17,967
how little you've thought of me
these last few years, so...

447
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,622
what do you need me to do?

448
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,973
Whatever
is inside there,
it's working.

449
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:27,020
The anti-matter wave
has stopped
and it's slowly dissipating.

450
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,631
How do we protect that thing
from an enemy we know
nothing about,

451
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:30,632
but we know is coming?

452
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:32,242
We head inside...

453
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:34,723
stake out strategic positions.

454
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:36,725
If we're fortified,
we control the battle.

455
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:43,819
Earthquake that magnitude
could overwhelm
the entire coast.

456
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:46,517
Go. Help contain the damage.

457
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,736
Go! We got this.

458
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,523
Let's go inside and dig in.

459
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,313
You've gotta be
kidding me.

460
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,924
What are the odds
that my son's pod landed here?

461
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:05,536
Three billion, eight hundred
and twenty seven million
to one.

462
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,887
Uh... but the pod
didn't land here.

463
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,237
But you said that
this is where Jonathan is.

464
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,413
Yes. This is where
I tracked him.

465
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:16,112
But I can't speculate
as to why Oliver Queen
would kidnap a baby.

466
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:18,114
Well, he probably thought
he was rescuing him.

467
00:27:18,158 --> 00:27:20,464
I mean, Star City is no place
for a child.

468
00:27:20,508 --> 00:27:22,336
Well, I'll thank him
when I have Jonathan back.

469
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:24,338
-In the meantime,
we should split up--

470
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,732
This is unnecessary.

471
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,215
Oliver?

472
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:34,740
Oliver.

473
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,138
Jonathan!

474
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:45,098
Yes. Yes, you go get Jonathan.
I'll...
I'll stay here,

475
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:02,332
What? No.

476
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,769
No, it's not possible.

477
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:05,988
You're dead.

478
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:07,468
You...

479
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,036
you went down with the Gambit.

480
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,909
But I came back. Remember?

481
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:15,389
I found you in Lian Yu.

482
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,001
I must be losing my mind.

483
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,090
-No, Ollie, you're not--
-Hey.

484
00:28:22,135 --> 00:28:26,095
You're not. You're...
It's just a long story.

485
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,359
The longest.

486
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:36,192
Thank you, Oliver.

487
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:40,806
Thank you for helping my baby.

488
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:49,771
So, what is this?

489
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,860
The proverbial calm
before the storm?

490
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:53,383
Something like that.

491
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:56,822
Remember, Mia,
whatever happens...

492
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:58,606
find your mother.

493
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,175
Tell her how much I love her.

494
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:10,661
Okay.

495
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:13,621
When Lyla said an army,

496
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:16,493
I thought
she meant an... army.

497
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:18,887
She did. It's just that...

498
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,020
we've never faced
one like this before.

499
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:34,337
"One army." She said,
"One army." It's more like ten!

500
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,994
-Very nice.
-Learned from the best.

501
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,040
-Take cover!

502
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,785
They're trying
to breach the tower.

503
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,308
Well, we can't let that happen!

504
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,832
I'll take that upgrade now.

505
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,921
Oh, uh, if I can have
one of those without
losing an appendage.

506
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:55,794
-Mmm-hmm.
-Oh, so cool!

507
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,273
Incredibly balanced.
Carbon fiber?

508
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:58,884
-Your friend talks a lot.
-Yeah, you get used to it.

509
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:00,537
Hey, Ray, focus!

510
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:02,452
Focusing.

511
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,237
Now, if we can just charge
your Batarang with
my compressed light energy.

512
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,412
Incoming!

513
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:17,424
Not bad.

514
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:27,869
Dad!

515
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,753
There's too many of them.

516
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,933
You want some help?

517
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,978
There's no need for panic.

518
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:53,634
Supergirl and Superman
are working hard
to save this planet.

519
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,332
Soon, alien ships will begin
circling the globe,

520
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:59,031
picking people up
and taking you to safety.

521
00:30:59,074 --> 00:30:59,988
-Hey.
-Hey.

522
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:01,163
Did Alex get Lena on board?

523
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:02,469
Yeah, they're working on
the portal now.

524
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:04,601
I just hope
J'onn can get enough ships.

525
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:07,169
There are literally
billions of people
to get off the planet.

526
00:31:07,213 --> 00:31:08,910
That's why Brainy left J'onn
his keys.

527
00:31:08,954 --> 00:31:10,869
Keys to what?

528
00:31:13,959 --> 00:31:15,047
The Legion left it here.

529
00:31:17,963 --> 00:31:19,312
Right on time, J'onn.

530
00:31:19,355 --> 00:31:21,053
Are you ready
to get this evacuation
underway?

531
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:23,620
Start getting people
into groups and I'll start
beaming them up.

532
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:26,145
Let's just hope Alex and Lena
get that portal on in time

533
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:27,973
so we have somewhere to go.

534
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,757
-Go ahead. This way.
-All right, people,
let's get in to the ship.

535
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,629
The quantum tower
is keeping the wave at bay.

536
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,153
Supergirl is...

537
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,676
fighting really hard
to protect it,

538
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:37,243
but we've got to get
this portal up and running.

539
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,940
I'm trying!
But the transmatter portal

540
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:41,116
works by synthesizing
polyelectronic anions.

541
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,335
And if I don't get
the energy levels right

542
00:31:42,378 --> 00:31:44,119
when I interface
with the breach device,

543
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:45,642
then the ships
will disintegrate
when they fly right through it.

544
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:48,515
-Right. That is not
a good option.
-No.

545
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:50,430
Have you thought about
using an inverse variable

546
00:31:50,473 --> 00:31:52,345
to help calculate
the differential?

547
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,260
Galleon's theory.

548
00:31:54,303 --> 00:31:56,131
That's smart.
An inverse beta-decay

549
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,742
to figure constituent quark,
that could work.

550
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:06,794
Thanks.

551
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,361
Yeah, um... just...

552
00:32:08,404 --> 00:32:10,885
keep working.
I've got your back.

553
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,629
I never thought
I'd see you again.

554
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,328
One of the benefits
of parallel Earths.

555
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:23,593
Parallel Earths?

556
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:28,642
It would appear that
your reality is a little...
stranger than mine.

557
00:32:28,685 --> 00:32:30,383
You really have no idea.

558
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:34,343
All my life...

559
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,522
I just wanted to...

560
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:42,699
to apologize
for bringing you
on that boat.

561
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:46,094
But you aren't even you.

562
00:32:46,703 --> 00:32:48,009
Ollie.

563
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:53,014
If your me was anything
like I was,

564
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:56,104
then getting on the Gambit
with you was her choice.

565
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,280
And in my world, that trip...

566
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:01,414
it set off
a whole series of events

567
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:04,199
that neither you or I
could've ever dreamed of.

568
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,073
You became a hero,

569
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:10,814
a husband, a father.

570
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,950
And I'm flying through time
happier than I've ever been.

571
00:33:17,604 --> 00:33:20,128
And none of that
would've ever happened

572
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:22,087
if I didn't get on
that boat with you.

573
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:25,960
It was destiny.

574
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,834
I'm... sorry to break up
what I'm sure must be

575
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:34,099
the strangest reunion
in the history of the world,

576
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:36,797
but, um,
if we don't leave now,

577
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,975
I'm afraid our extrapolator
might not have enough power
for us to return home.

578
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,282
Wait, what's an extrapolator?

579
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,457
It's another long story.

580
00:33:48,983 --> 00:33:50,506
You're a good man...

581
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:52,639
on every Earth.

582
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,089
-Is that it?
-Like that was easy?

583
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,612
They're on the roof.

584
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:17,403
What's happening out there?

585
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,840
The skies are red again, the anti-matter wave's moving,

586
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:21,363
and the portal isn't open yet.

587
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:23,017
-There's more
shadow demons incoming.

588
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,933
Kara, Clark, get to the roof.

589
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:28,196
Get the tower operational
again. We'll stay behind
and hold them off.

590
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,335
Are those solar panels?

591
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,119
Looks close enough.

592
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,947
We won't be able
to power it definitely.

593
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,210
We just need to buy more time.

594
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:45,170
We might lose
the planet, but we can
still save the people.

595
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:53,830
You almost got it?

596
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,049
Almost done, I think.

597
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,704
Yes! Systems are a go.

598
00:34:57,747 --> 00:35:01,011
Calculating destination...
destination set.

599
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:04,928
Smart call
with Galleon's theory.

600
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,714
Oh, lucky guess. But you're
the real genius here, so...

601
00:35:08,802 --> 00:35:11,239
Don't mistake us
working together
for friendship.

602
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,762
I told you before,

603
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:15,243
Kara and you showed me
who you were and I accept that.

604
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,552
Now, let's go help people
get on these ships.

605
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,969
-That was too close
for comfort.

606
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,233
Always gotta one-up me, huh?

607
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,669
-Did it work?
-You did it.

608
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,540
The tower is working again
and the portal is open.

609
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,542
Uh, but the ships
better be fast.

610
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:56,458
The Supers' charge didn't
actually stop the wave,
it just slowed it down.

611
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,243
According to
Brainy's algorithm,
we have 14 minutes

612
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,809
before it makes contact
with Earth.

613
00:35:59,853 --> 00:36:01,811
Well, then
we better make
every minute count.

614
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:04,031
We've got your back.

615
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:07,469
We need to keep those
shadow demons at bay until
every last ship gets through--

616
00:36:17,436 --> 00:36:18,611
All right, get to the ships!

617
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:20,352
Keep your eyes open
for debris, people!

618
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,136
Keep it orderly, people.
Come on.

619
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:30,927
James left it for me.

620
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:52,122
The battle is lost!

621
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,778
We must retreat
and save our resources
for battles yet to come.

622
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,882
Oliver! Oli--

623
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,408
Oliver! It is time!

624
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,931
Has the planet been
evacuated yet?

625
00:37:17,974 --> 00:37:19,019
Not entirely.

626
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,021
Then it's not time.

627
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,781
Oliver.

628
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,783
He fought to his last breath.

629
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:30,699
Knowing every moment
was another life saved.

630
00:38:30,743 --> 00:38:33,049
-Saved?
-Your universe is no more.

631
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:35,922
Of 7.53 billion...

632
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:39,012
three billion souls
made it to Earth-1

633
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:40,840
on the armada of ships.

634
00:38:40,883 --> 00:38:45,584
I calculate one billion souls
survived due to
his noble sacrifice.

635
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,551
Nash?

636
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:57,813
Once upon a time.
Not anymore.

637
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:00,773
Now, I'm simply a man
serving his penance.

638
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:03,166
Penance for what?

639
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,561
I freed the Anti-Monitor
from his confinement only...

640
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:10,304
to become a... Pariah.

641
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,786
Sentenced to bear witness
to his actions.

642
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:19,879
Oliver!

643
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,491
It's okay, Sara.

644
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,190
This is my destiny.

645
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,366
-Oliver.
-Barry?

646
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:33,196
You, my friend...

647
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,155
are the very best of us.

648
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,072
I gave it all up...

649
00:39:40,203 --> 00:39:41,640
for you and Kara.

650
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:44,512
What-- What do you mean?

651
00:39:44,556 --> 00:39:46,514
I need the two of you to...

652
00:39:48,473 --> 00:39:49,648
be the one to...

653
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:52,172
to save us now.

654
00:39:56,002 --> 00:39:56,829
Mia...

655
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:58,483
Dad.

656
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,921
Don't forget
to find your mother.

657
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:03,531
Okay.

658
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:06,273
Find William.

659
00:40:08,536 --> 00:40:10,320
Tell him how much I love him.

660
00:40:13,106 --> 00:40:14,673
I love you, Mia.

661
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:19,286
You keep me
in your heart, okay?

662
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,202
-Dad...
-Okay?

663
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:42,657
It was
not supposed to be like this.

664
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:45,051
This is not his ending
I foresaw.

665
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:50,317
Things are turning out
differently than I expected.

666
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,232
But one thing is certain.

667
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:55,583
Everything we know...

668
00:40:56,671 --> 00:40:58,630
everything there is...

669
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,806
and everything
there ever was...

670
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,898
is doomed.
