1
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,256
Open.

2
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:54,271
No!

3
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,404
Aah!

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,253
Aah!

5
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:45,322
Mama!

6
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,984
Hurry, Mama!

7
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,293
Mama!

8
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,991
Mama, hurry!

9
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,168
Mama!

10
00:02:18,312 --> 00:02:21,228
I'm so sorry, Mama.

11
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:24,970
You almost got us killed
again.

12
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:30,019
Mama, there's a man.

13
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:39,219
It is time that
the pack returns.

14
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,874
There is more gathering to be done,

15
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,268
Guardians to be found.

16
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:48,924
We are far from the enemy.

17
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,274
Their fear will subside.

18
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,452
They will fear us no matter where we are.

19
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:59,369
They fill fear us because of what we did.

20
00:03:59,413 --> 00:04:03,504
Do you doubt me?
Our mission?

21
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,288
Never.

22
00:04:08,422 --> 00:04:11,207
Take the sisters
when you depart.

23
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:17,213
They have a real gift, a scent for the dead.

24
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,312
We don't mean harm.

25
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:37,451
Can you talk?

26
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:52,379
Mama, I don't like this.
Please...

27
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:55,730
Go on and try to kill us.

28
00:04:55,773 --> 00:05:01,431
But know two things -- One, I do not die easily,

29
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:04,521
and, two, you must also kill my daughter

30
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:07,916
because I will not leave this Earth without her.

31
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:17,404
One night.

32
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,538
Thank you.

33
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,411
Do not leave this hallway.

34
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:30,460
Do you think
I could wash up?

35
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:33,855
Sorry, Mama,
but the smell... Is there water?

36
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:45,649
Is he a monster?

37
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,046
We're all monsters now.

38
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:57,922
Beta: Be on alert.

39
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,795
Buildings could be full.

40
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,275
Male Whisperer #1:
Gather all of them?

41
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,669
Every last one
we can find.

42
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:21,424
Split up. We track better apart.

43
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,341
Did you hear me?

44
00:07:07,252 --> 00:07:09,690
He's watching you.

45
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,997
Frances: The sun feels...
different today.

46
00:07:14,564 --> 00:07:17,437
Can you feel that,
sister?

47
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,483
Like it's burning
right into our skin.

48
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:24,574
Stop it. Your head's in the clouds again.

49
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,795
He'll see that you're not committed to the cause...

50
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:29,797
to her.

51
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,020
Don't say that.

52
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,506
I should've left you behind when I had the chance.

53
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,210
I hear them.

54
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,995
Over there.

55
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,591
Shh.

56
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,546
Were you singing?

57
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,375
Wouldn't call it that.

58
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:12,595
Don't do it again.

59
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,693
You have a name?

60
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:26,566
The dead
don't have names.

61
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,873
And we shouldn't,
either.

62
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:32,615
Without names or a past,

63
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:35,705
those of us strong enough
to still be alive out here

64
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:38,447
can know each other
on a primal level.

65
00:09:45,497 --> 00:09:48,283
They fear nothing.

66
00:09:48,326 --> 00:09:50,981
They want only to feed.

67
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:54,724
They are free.

68
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:02,340
How'd you end up
in here?

69
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:06,606
Got into a tussle
with the dead,

70
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,696
ran me out of my camp a few months ago.

71
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,046
Is that why
you wear that?

72
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,486
Lydia: Mama, come back!

73
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:23,579
I like it...

74
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,452
...the sound
of the dead.

75
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:31,848
It's the only song I never want to end.

76
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:01,633
Sister, focus.

77
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,972
What is wrong with you?

78
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:42,762
You will pay.

79
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:51,031
I'm sorry.

80
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:54,034
I'm sorry.

81
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,645
I'm sorry.

82
00:12:56,688 --> 00:12:59,474
I don't feel...

83
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,781
he's better there.

84
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:05,219
I love him, and he's gone.

85
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:15,316
He's with them
in a better place!

86
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,621
Alpha: Stop!

87
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:51,569
Beta: She is an uncommitted now.

88
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:55,922
Her actions threatened
the entire pack.

89
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,796
Leaving her child
broke her.

90
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,627
You will never understand how it feels to abandon your child.

91
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,586
You still think
of Lydia.

92
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,851
She was dead to me
long before I ended her.

93
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:23,471
Bring her to me
in the deeper place.

94
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,125
I'll be waiting.

95
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,743
You're gonna sleep
in here.

96
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:37,354
I'll be right outside.

97
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,966
It'll be quiet.

98
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:42,882
Why are there big pillows
all over the walls?

99
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:47,016
So the people put in here wouldn't hurt themselves.

100
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,978
People like that man out there?

101
00:14:53,196 --> 00:14:56,939
These walls could never control someone like that.

102
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:02,336
You like him?

103
00:15:02,379 --> 00:15:04,642
Uh-huh.

104
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,999
I don't want it.

105
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,393
You've never slept
without her --

106
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,048
I don't want it.

107
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,485
I'm not a baby anymore.

108
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,010
I don't want
that stupid bunny.

109
00:15:24,053 --> 00:15:25,533
I don't want
to be scared.

110
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:29,189
I want to be more like you,
Mama.

111
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:37,023
I've waited so long
to hear that.

112
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:44,769
And I hope
that you will...

113
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,903
because if you can't,

114
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,689
I'll have no choice but to leave you behind.

115
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,343
Please, Mama,
don't ever leave me.

116
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,259
I promise I'll do better
out there. I will.

117
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,392
You'll see.

118
00:16:00,785 --> 00:16:03,179
I love you, Mama.

119
00:16:05,138 --> 00:16:06,617
Stop calling me that.

120
00:16:37,822 --> 00:16:41,130
Alpha, I'm sorry.

121
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,220
Please.

122
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,877
I won't talk about him
again.

123
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,401
Please.

124
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:54,970
Remove your mask.

125
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,642
Kneel.

126
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:12,613
Shh.

127
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:15,224
Shh.

128
00:18:15,268 --> 00:18:18,271
Shh.

129
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:23,885
Thank you.

130
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,756
Thank you.

131
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,237
Thank you.

132
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,971
Alpha showed you
her grace?

133
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,497
I'll never stray again,
sister.

134
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:15,284
We keep thinking about
that place, too.

135
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,287
It looked so safe.
There was livestock.

136
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:20,942
We can all go back.
We can get --

137
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:37,306
Why?

138
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,917
Do not question me.

139
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:43,269
But if she strays again, I will skin her alive for all to see.

140
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,967
She unsettles the pack.

141
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,013
Then we keep a close eye, make sure her moment of weakness doesn't infect the others.

142
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:54,280
The others have already spoken of the enemy, the life they saw.

143
00:19:54,323 --> 00:19:57,152
It is not a life.
It is a fantasy.

144
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,242
And the pack
must learn that again.

145
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:03,289
They must see it
up close.

146
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,899
They will.
When?

147
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:06,466
Soon.

148
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:15,475
Are you content?

149
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:23,700
I have seen you wander away
from the camp alone at night.

150
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:30,316
I am right here...

151
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:33,101
as I've always been.

152
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,970
I like killing
with you.

153
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:20,469
Oh, you're different.

154
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:23,211
People who knew me
before all this

155
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:26,345
would probably say
the same thing.

156
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,175
Never trusted
those people, anyway.

157
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,135
I don't hardly
trust anyone.

158
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,485
Neither do I.

159
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:49,585
Well done, Big Man.

160
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,547
"Big Man"?
Okay.

161
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,201
"Mr. B."

162
00:22:57,245 --> 00:23:00,117
I thought we didn't have names.

163
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:03,556
It's not a name.
It's a letter.

164
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,864
So, if I'm "B," what does that make you?

165
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:10,389
"A."

166
00:23:18,832 --> 00:23:22,618
So, you can move with them when you're covered?

167
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:26,666
It's not just about
moving with them.

168
00:23:26,709 --> 00:23:31,845
You got to become them,
feel what they feel.

169
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,542
And what do they feel?

170
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:35,631
Nothing.

171
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:38,504
There are only two kinds of people left in this world --

172
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:42,464
the ones brave enough
to walk with the dead

173
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:45,424
and everybody else.

174
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,514
So, tell me, B,

175
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,212
which one are you?

176
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:05,008
Leave.

177
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:08,403
At sunrise.

178
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,884
Don't come back.

179
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:44,526
What was it like,
To be alone with her?

180
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,662
Just as you'd imagine.

181
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:57,496
She's powerful,
so calm.

182
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:00,716
My head finally feels right again.

183
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,982
So, you are no longer
thinking of him?

184
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:08,463
I'm glad I made that sacrifice.

185
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:12,598
As Alpha sacrificed
her daughter.

186
00:25:14,295 --> 00:25:16,427
She said when she watched her die,

187
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:18,952
she didn't shed one tear.

188
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,698
She is Alpha.

189
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,571
She doesn't cry.

190
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:34,445
I'm so sorry...

191
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,404
for risking
what we have here.

192
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,754
I know.

193
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:45,718
Don't do it again...

194
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,763
ever.

195
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:56,380
Did you mean what you said before,

196
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,818
you wish you'd left me behind?

197
00:26:07,174 --> 00:26:09,829
Go to sleep, sis.

198
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,762
Alpha: Pull them back.

199
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:17,897
Beta: Steady.
Do not break.

200
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:25,774
There's too many.

201
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:28,385
Stay the course.

202
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,126
I want them.

203
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,800
Bring him.

204
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,497
You brought a baby
out here?

205
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,424
No!

206
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,540
Aah!

207
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:23,762
Do you regret
what you did?

208
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:33,293
She was an uncommitted.

209
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:36,687
She no longer
belonged with us.

210
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:40,996
I had to protect
the Alpha.

211
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:45,218
And you did.

212
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,960
It was your destiny.

213
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:53,052
As the lion who smothers
her wailing cub,

214
00:29:53,095 --> 00:29:56,838
we're strongest
when we kill our own blood.

215
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,232
It is the purest,
most honest way

216
00:29:59,275 --> 00:30:02,061
to bring order to chaos.

217
00:30:02,104 --> 00:30:05,673
Your purity
will never be forgotten.

218
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,983
Yes, Alpha.

219
00:30:15,596 --> 00:30:18,207
I see greatness in you.

220
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,650
There's a tear.

221
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,478
Should I repair it?

222
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:33,527
Beta: Leave us.

223
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:52,894
Are you hurt?

224
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:57,290
I never felt more calm.

225
00:30:57,333 --> 00:30:58,987
Calm?

226
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,341
We lost three of our own, and many more of the dead,

227
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,866
and you are calm?

228
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,739
It was mayhem.

229
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,703
There is clarity
amid the chaos.

230
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:26,058
She fears nothing.

231
00:31:44,424 --> 00:31:45,425
Hmm.

232
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:15,716
Lydia:
We're all monsters now.

233
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,328
We're all monsters now.

234
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,854
We're all monsters now.

235
00:32:26,118 --> 00:32:28,990
We're all...monsters now.

236
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:32,428
For your bravery
and sacrifice

237
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:37,956
and for putting the needs
of the pack above your own,

238
00:32:37,999 --> 00:32:39,827
I anoint you Gamma.

239
00:32:49,228 --> 00:32:52,187
To Gamma.

240
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,449
To Gamma.

241
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:54,973
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

242
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,018
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

243
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,368
All: To Gamma.
To Gamma.

244
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,588
To Gamma. To Gamma.

245
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:03,677
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

246
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,635
To Gamma. To Gamma.

247
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,160
To Gamma.
To Gamma.

248
00:33:08,203 --> 00:33:11,163
To Gamma. To Gamma.
To Gamma.

249
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,741
You've been gone
for hours.

250
00:33:26,221 --> 00:33:28,049
Are you angry with me?

251
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:32,401
I feel nothing for you.

252
00:33:34,664 --> 00:33:38,320
I am also empty,
as Alpha wants.

253
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:41,062
Where is she?

254
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:44,718
I saw her moving toward the old camp a while ago.

255
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:01,561
Lydia:
We're all monsters now.

256
00:34:01,604 --> 00:34:05,304
We're all...monsters...now.

257
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:14,356
We're all monsters now.

258
00:35:22,946 --> 00:35:24,948
Alpha: Lydia?

259
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,649
Lydia?

260
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:37,004
Lydia?

261
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,266
Have you
lost your way?

262
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:23,181
Have you?

263
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:28,925
I told you never to come over here.

264
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:34,279
I-I need to
find my daughter.

265
00:36:34,322 --> 00:36:37,064
I don't care.

266
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:41,111
You kept that?

267
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,506
This is for Lydia.

268
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:52,949
You said she was dead, that you killed her.

269
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:56,649
You want her back.

270
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:01,262
You shouldn't have
come here.

271
00:37:01,306 --> 00:37:03,395
Why?

272
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,528
Why did you lie to me?

273
00:37:07,921 --> 00:37:10,489
She is never coming back,

274
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,622
no matter how much
you wish for it

275
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:18,148
or how hard you try to
replace her with someone else.

276
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:22,979
She is gone, Alpha!

277
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:31,292
No!

278
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:34,774
She's my daughter.
She's my baby.

279
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:39,692
I could not kill her.

280
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,891
They can't know.

281
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:09,025
They cannot know
Lydia's alive.

282
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:11,245
They cannot know.

283
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,509
They won't.

284
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:17,120
Lydia is dead.

285
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:19,297
Lydia is dead to me.

286
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,996
She was dead the moment she was born...

287
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,564
'cause she was not
like me.

288
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:32,571
Because she was not like me. Because she was not like me.

289
00:38:34,224 --> 00:38:36,052
She was not like me.

290
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:37,793
She was not like me!

291
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:41,144
She was not...like...me!

292
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:44,017
She was not like me!

293
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,672
She was not like me!!

294
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,382
I know you better
than you know yourself.

295
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:04,167
You've got demons,
yeah, just like me.

296
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:05,517
But you are not broken!

297
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,041
You were made for this.
Aah!

298
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:12,262
No! Stop! No!
She's trying to save you!

299
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,970
My baby.

300
00:39:26,625 --> 00:39:29,454
Mama, I was strong. You were, baby.

301
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:31,760
And I'm so proud
of you.

302
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:35,111
But don't you dare, dare ever leave me again!

303
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:37,723
You hear me?!

304
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,479
The world, it went dark

305
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:58,091
so that we could
see a new path.

306
00:39:58,134 --> 00:40:00,963
So come.

307
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:02,400
Come on.

308
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:06,142
Walk with me
in the darkness.

309
00:40:06,186 --> 00:40:08,449
Walk with me,

310
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:11,191
and you will never
be alone again.

311
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:13,454
My "B."

312
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:16,631
I am the end
of the world.

313
00:40:16,675 --> 00:40:20,461
I am the end of the world.

314
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:24,291
I am the end
of the world.

315
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:29,339
We are the end
of the world.

316
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:32,908
We are the end
of the world.

317
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,231
Come with us.

318
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:55,453
I can't leave him.

319
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,154
You won't have to.

320
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:43,065
I saw smoke
by the border.

321
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:50,725
The enemy
may have crossed.

322
00:41:53,336 --> 00:41:55,382
We must teach them
a lesson.

323
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:58,559
And the pack will watch.

324
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:01,649
We're going back.

325
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:23,584
Both:
We walk in darkness.

326
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,804
We are free.

327
00:42:25,847 --> 00:42:28,546
We bathe in blood.

328
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,460
We are free.

329
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:32,985
We love nothing.

330
00:42:33,028 --> 00:42:35,422
We are free.

331
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,598
We fear nothing.

332
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:40,079
We are free.

333
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:42,385
We need no words.

334
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:43,735
We are free.

335
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:47,129
We embrace all death.

336
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,435
We are free.

337
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:56,008
This is the end of the world.

338
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:04,625
Now is the end of the world.

339
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:11,763
We are the end of the world.
