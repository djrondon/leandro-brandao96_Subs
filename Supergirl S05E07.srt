1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:02,611
Previously onSupergirl...

2
00:00:02,654 --> 00:00:05,135
My fiancee died fighting
on the front lines.

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,050
I saw Alex almost die.

4
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:08,312
Give me the medallion.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,663
Can you translate
these markings?

6
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,492
I got something
from Rip Roar. A name.

7
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,103
Leviathan.

8
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:17,669
I can use Supergirl
to achieve my ends.

9
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:20,498
That is easier to do if she believes there is trust.

10
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,631
Malefic's back
in the Phantom Zone.

11
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,024
You like it here, don't you?

12
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,634
I like it very much.

13
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,641
You're off your game today,
Supergirl.

14
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:40,040
I could say the same to you.

15
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,263
Not so fast.

16
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:48,787
I need to be ready.

17
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:59,102
We don't know when
Leviathan will strike next.

18
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,235
We don't even know
what it is.

19
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:02,627
And what are they after?

20
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,065
All these unknowns
make me feel anxious.

21
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,719
And when I feel anxious,
I want to punch things.

22
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,604
We've faced
unknown dangers before.

23
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:24,867
This feels different.

24
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,390
I have a bad feeling about it.

25
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,176
Well, Alex has the DEO
working overtime
on Leviathan.

26
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:31,178
Are you sure something else
isn't bothering you?

27
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,572
Before I told Lena
I was Supergirl,

28
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:36,748
I was terrified
how she would react.

29
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,360
I was so afraid
I was going to
ruin the friendship.

30
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:43,320
Ugh.  I still hate
thinking about it.

31
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:45,105
Watching William
lose his friend

32
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:46,715
hit a little too close to home.

33
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,373
J'onn? J'onn?

34
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,554
You can come out now.

35
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:03,688
Give me the medallion.

36
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:07,649
I don't think so.

37
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,698
I have the most intricate
security system in the world.

38
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,917
I know all about Leviathan.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,354
No one knows
all about Leviathan.

40
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,877
Leviathan is unknowable.

41
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,052
I'm not afraid.

42
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:21,228
You will be.

43
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:30,541
She's gone.

44
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:33,631
I've reactivated
heightened penthouse security.

45
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:36,591
You were right
as always, Ms. Luthor.

46
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:40,638
Leviathan will attempt
to retrieve the medallion
at all costs.

47
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:43,119
But why would you provoke them
over something of no value?

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,990
It has value to me.

49
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:46,601
The medallion was
special to my mother,

50
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:49,212
and the fact that Leviathan
wants it makes it useful.

51
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,475
Lex theorized that Superman
kept every weapon

52
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,566
that was ever used against him
in a special facility,
a fortress.

53
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,352
And although he never found it,
I think Lex was right.

54
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,659
I think the perfect
dispersal device

55
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:04,053
for Project Non Nocere
is hidden there,

56
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,446
gathering dust.

57
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,231
And Leviathan is
gonna help me find it.

58
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,712
Please don't underestimate
the danger of Leviathan.

59
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:13,280
You should cancel
the L-Corp event at the park.

60
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:14,629
They will come after you.

61
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:15,760
Let them come.

62
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,677
Supergirl will save me.

63
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,948
Tell us exactly
what happened.

64
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,341
I already told you, I'm fine.

65
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,038
Alex, you should be
tracking Leviathan.

66
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:35,345
Yes, and Rip Roar,
but Brainy's on that,

67
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,260
so just stop deflecting.

68
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:42,309
Before I fell, I was seized
by another vision of Malefic.

69
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,267
"Another"? You've had
more of these?

70
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:47,357
Yesterday. I felt Malefic
during the psychic attack.

71
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,099
It's as if I can sense him
all around me.

72
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,449
But how? We sent him
to the Phantom Zone.

73
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,451
All I can think is
these flashes are...

74
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:57,715
maybe symptoms of my guilt.

75
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:00,936
I know we had no choice
but to send Malefic back
to the Phantom Zone, but...

76
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,939
I mean, he's too dangerous
to be contained here on Earth.

77
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:05,332
Even so, I can't help feeling

78
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,811
I've wronged my brother again.

79
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,770
This is the third time

80
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,380
he's been sentenced
to confinement by my hand.

81
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,035
No, your brother
made his own decisions.

82
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,080
You can't blame yourself
for that.

83
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:17,909
But it seems like you're going
through some sort of trauma.

84
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,259
Maybe Kelly can help.

85
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,261
She can't provide
the help I need.

86
00:04:21,304 --> 00:04:22,871
I'll deal with this
the Martian way.

87
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,772
Where's the medallion?

88
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,774
I...

89
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,342
I couldn't retrieve it.

90
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,824
It was a simple task.

91
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,087
It would have been simple
with any other human, but...

92
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,481
she is a Luthor.

93
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,918
Do you know how long that
I've been safeguarding
this planet?

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,659
Since the beginning.

95
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,792
And since our ship,
as big as an asteroid,

96
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,055
wiped out the dinosaurs.

97
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:19,623
Then humanity rose...

98
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,886
and became a scourge
to this planet,

99
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,975
and for eons we have kept

100
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,369
their destructive behavior
at bay, but now...

101
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,458
They're ravaging the Earth
like never before,

102
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:31,722
and I granted you the privilege

103
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:34,856
of serving our cause,
and you failed.

104
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:36,814
Is it her failure,
Rama Khan?

105
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,035
Or is it yours?

106
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,384
You can go, Margot.

107
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:52,177
Using a carrot
instead of a stick

108
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,875
is not what we need right now.

109
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,753
Well, they are known as
the "snowflake generation."

110
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:04,451
So what does that mean,
they melt?

111
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,670
Never mind.

112
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,197
You and I both share
the same goal...

113
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:15,418
of wanting to put a stop
to people who disrespect
this planet.

114
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,377
I'm here to offer my help.

115
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,465
How can you help?

116
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,249
The world is shifting,
evolving.

117
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,555
Moving faster than it ever has.

118
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:24,079
We have to remain
ahead of the curve.

119
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,820
The old ways aren't working--

120
00:06:25,863 --> 00:06:28,562
Oh, the rising of oceans
and the raging of rivers
will always work.

121
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:31,434
Give the brute force
a rest, Rama Khan.

122
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,872
Let's try my technology.

123
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:38,441
Our elder left the caretaking
of this planet to me...

124
00:06:39,268 --> 00:06:40,443
for a reason.

125
00:06:43,794 --> 00:06:46,188
You want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

126
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:53,500
Thank you all
for coming on
such a wonderful day.

127
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,155
What was that?

128
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,027
Running these trails
has always been my favorite way
to clear my mind.

129
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,856
- What was that?
- Did you feel that?

130
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:04,293
It means
so much to me

131
00:07:04,336 --> 00:07:06,861
that L-Corp can have a hand
in preserving these grounds.

132
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,788
You have something
that belongs to me.

133
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,936
-What was that?

134
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,850
Leviathan.

135
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,788
Thank God for selfie culture.

136
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:08,705
Because of this generation's
constant need to
livestream everything,

137
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,664
we've got a clear image
of your attacker.

138
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,318
And I knew I had seen
that face before.

139
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:15,538
Do you recall Antioch,
526 AD?

140
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,192
It was an earthquake.

141
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,499
It was the eighth-largest
natural disaster
in modern history.

142
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:21,588
Precisely. It's good
to have you back, Lena.

143
00:08:21,631 --> 00:08:24,112
A myth was born that
this man was the cause.

144
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:28,116
Now, of course, scientists
insisted that the natural
disasters were natural,

145
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,337
but, in an ironic twist
of history, they were wrong...

146
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,383
and the fearmongers were right.

147
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:35,993
Several reliable sources place

148
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,995
this man at
the scene of the crime
throughout history.

149
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,912
Pompeii, the Yellow River flood
of 1887, the Bhola Cyclone,

150
00:08:41,956 --> 00:08:44,349
even as far back as
Noah's flood,

151
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:45,916
this Earth-Bender
has been spotted.

152
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,353
Excuse me, did you say
"Earth-Bender"?

153
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:49,572
How else would you
describe him?

154
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,269
He... He literally
manipulates the earth.

155
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,794
Wait, Pompeii? Noah's flood?

156
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,057
I mean, what is he,
thousands of years old?

157
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,538
Correct. Which means
that he is an alien

158
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,889
with powers of longevity
this civilization
has never conceived of.

159
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:04,587
No wonder people
thought he was a myth.

160
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:07,938
With all this destruction,
his existence is still
shrouded in mystery.

161
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:11,115
He's managed
to convince the world
he doesn't exist.

162
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,726
It seems so.

163
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:16,294
The word "Leviathan"
occurs six times
in the Hebrew Bible.

164
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:19,515
Never once does it appear
in any historical
scientific literature.

165
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,040
So how are we supposed to
fight a highly secretive,
thousand-year-old alien

166
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,173
with powers that we have
no idea how to beat?

167
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,392
Well, I know
one person who spent
his life fighting aliens,

168
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,307
-both real and imagined.
-Your brother.

169
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,049
I know most of
his minor weapons
are in Fort Summit,

170
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:35,618
but his truly horrendous ones,
they were all destroyed
by Superman.

171
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:37,141
That's not necessarily true.

172
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,753
A lot of Lex's weapons are
in the Fortress of Solitude.

173
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,845
Oh, it's... It's a place
Superman created.

174
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,586
We keep things there
that can harm us.

175
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,326
Well, you just go
to the Fortress,

176
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,198
and I'll give you a list
of every weapon
that Lex ever created.

177
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,767
Why don't you come with me?

178
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,812
I mean, there's no telling
what weapons we'll encounter.

179
00:09:55,856 --> 00:09:58,685
And then, Brainy and I
will stay here, and we'll
continue our search

180
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,644
for Rip Roar
and this Earth-Bender.

181
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,908
Supergirl, remember
the strongest, most potent
weapon is knowledge.

182
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:07,650
So send me
whatever you can find
from the Fortress database.

183
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,913
You ready for a road trip?

184
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,917
Are you sure me going
is a good idea?

185
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,353
Of course. Why wouldn't it be?

186
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,529
I don't know. A Luthor
in the Fortress of Solitude?

187
00:10:17,573 --> 00:10:20,141
It's gonna
be great. But you're
gonna need a jacket.

188
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,624
Father,

189
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:28,410
I haven't been this lost
since after I killed
Manchester Black.

190
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,325
You came to me then.

191
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:33,328
You helped me find myself.

192
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:37,027
I need your help now.

193
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:47,255
J'onn, my son!

194
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:51,346
Father.
It's good to see you.

195
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:58,396
I am... I am so sorry.

196
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,661
I know now what I did.

197
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,794
It was unforgivable.

198
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:07,101
When I wiped your mind
of Malefic...

199
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,191
I committed the greatest sin.

200
00:11:10,234 --> 00:11:11,932
No, J'onn.

201
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,804
It was I who failed.

202
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:18,547
All you did was ease
your father's suffering.

203
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,853
I forced your hand.

204
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,769
I take full responsibility.

205
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:28,818
But that's not the reason
I'm here, is it?

206
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,691
Uh, no.

207
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:34,868
Father, I need your counsel.

208
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,958
Malefic came after my family,

209
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:41,004
and history repeated itself.

210
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,268
To protect them,
I had to send Mal back
to the Phantom Zone.

211
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,662
I have tried to move on,

212
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,969
but it's like
I can feel him nearby.

213
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,058
That's because he is nearby.

214
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,931
-What?
-Your brother is here.

215
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:56,890
You mean here in my mind?

216
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,848
No.

217
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:01,155
I mean, he's across town.

218
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:06,203
Anything?

219
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,206
I went back to the scene
of Lena's attack and collected
samples of the soil.

220
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,253
I am also scanning
for the Earth-Bender's
seismic wave signature.

221
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,342
Nothing so far.

222
00:12:16,126 --> 00:12:17,127
Earth-Bender?

223
00:12:18,607 --> 00:12:21,088
It's Rip Roar. We found him.

224
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:26,876
He's not moving.

225
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,095
Did they take him out?

226
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:29,357
Why?

227
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,491
Fall back.

228
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,725
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

229
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,944
I am intact.

230
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,904
You're the fragile human.
Are you harmed?

231
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,297
I don't think so...

232
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,908
but I am furious.

233
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,257
They dangled Rip Roar,

234
00:13:00,301 --> 00:13:02,607
knowing that we would
take the bait, and now...

235
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,826
we've got nothing.

236
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,046
Not nothing.

237
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:07,787
We still have Rip Roar's armor.

238
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,572
We should start
studying it immediately.

239
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,748
-Oh...
-Alex.

240
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,837
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

241
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,318
Oh, but you have a nasty cut.

242
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,422
There. Perfect as always.

243
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:38,165
Director Danvers!

244
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:48,436
Wow! This is... breathtaking.

245
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,003
It's our Krypton on Earth.

246
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:06,671
Intruder! Intruder!

247
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:07,934
What's happening?

248
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:08,978
Luthor DNA detected.

249
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,414
L-Protocol engage.

250
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,503
"L-Protocol"? No.
No, no, no, no, no!

251
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,505
Luthor, relinquish your Kryptonite ring

252
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:16,420
and your transmatter
portal watch immediately.

253
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,988
I don't have a ring
or a watch.
I'm not Lex!

254
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,034
Hand over
the weapons at once,

255
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:24,211
or the Fortress will
take offensive action
in ten seconds.

256
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:25,473
She's unarmed.

257
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,910
-Ten, nine, eight...
-I'll fix this.

258
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,870
-...seven, six, five...
-Come on, come on.

259
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,176
...four, three, two...

260
00:14:34,743 --> 00:14:36,310
L-Protocol terminated.

261
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:39,530
Sorry. I had no idea

262
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:42,577
Superman would take
such extreme measures.

263
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,274
No, if Lex knew
about this place,

264
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:47,756
he would do anything
or kill anyone
to get in here, so...

265
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:49,366
Well,
you are not Lex.

266
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,542
And you are not your cousin.

267
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,241
We're miles beyond those boys

268
00:14:54,284 --> 00:14:55,677
with their sticks
and their stones.

269
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,548
Yes, we are.

270
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:01,552
Malefic is in National City,
and he needs your help.

271
00:15:01,596 --> 00:15:03,206
My help!

272
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,252
If what you say is true,
then everyone I love
is in danger.

273
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,645
Your brother cannot harm them.

274
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:08,908
He is a prisoner.

275
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,083
A prisoner?

276
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,259
Of whom?

277
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,391
That you must discover
on your own.

278
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:19,092
Father, you have to help me.

279
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,094
How can I find him?

280
00:15:21,137 --> 00:15:22,660
You must make a choice.

281
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:27,100
Banish your brother
once and for all...

282
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,407
or save his soul.

283
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:33,889
However, there is only one way

284
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,282
to reach Malefic.

285
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,285
And it requires you to...

286
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:42,071
risk your own death
by his hand.

287
00:15:47,207 --> 00:15:48,077
Kelly.

288
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,818
What're you doing here?

289
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,037
Brainy texted Nia that

290
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,126
you were both involved
in an explosion.

291
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,302
So I rushed over.

292
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:57,434
Really, you have...
You have nothing...

293
00:15:57,478 --> 00:16:00,568
You have nothing
to worry about.

294
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:04,964
No, no. No, don't do that.
Don't cry.

295
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,226
Because if you cry,
then I'm gonna cry,

296
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:08,097
and you know I really hate
crying at work.

297
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:12,493
You should have called.

298
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,668
I should have, I'm sorry.

299
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:17,977
And next time, I will.
I promise.

300
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:23,678
Okay.

301
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,158
Wait.
What're you doing?

302
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,639
I have to go back to work.

303
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:30,032
You were nearly just blown up,

304
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:33,035
and you have a mild concussion.

305
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,516
You can't go back out there
until you're 100 percent.

306
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,346
Okay.

307
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,004
We're almost to
the central database.

308
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,093
Assuming the Fortress
doesn't attack me again.

309
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,008
Thank you for saving me
back there.

310
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,226
I shouldn't have had to,

311
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,923
but it does seem like
dangerous saves

312
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,534
are sort of our thing now.

313
00:16:53,577 --> 00:16:55,144
Yeah, it does.

314
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,712
Of course, it used to be me

315
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,496
being the one
that's saving you.

316
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,196
Imagine, I thought I was
protecting my fragile,
vulnerable friend.

317
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,459
I'm so sorry.

318
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,504
Remember when we went
to Kaznia and the jet
was crashing?

319
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,463
And I was frantic
to try and save us,

320
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:12,248
desperate to save my friend
before myself...

321
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:14,685
Little did I know that
that friend could actually fly.

322
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,167
I'm so sorry
I put you through that.

323
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:19,516
No, it was impressive

324
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,866
how often you saved me
without me realizing...

325
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,043
I mean, you're
an excellent actress.

326
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,002
Telling you the truth
was such a relief,

327
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,482
and I'm so glad that now

328
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,961
we can be honest
with each other

329
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:31,659
and all of that is behind us.

330
00:17:33,443 --> 00:17:34,705
Me too.

331
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:35,750
It's this way.

332
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,235
Are you happy now?

333
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,454
No. I've searched the globe.
I can't find them.

334
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,719
With all your power,
you were defeated,

335
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,505
you still don't have
the medallion,
and you lost them?

336
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,723
I will fix this.

337
00:17:58,164 --> 00:18:01,689
Rama Khan,
we're on the same side.

338
00:18:02,777 --> 00:18:04,387
Let me help you.

339
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:07,129
Your power has kept things
in alignment for ages,

340
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,088
but the world has changed.

341
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:11,351
Humans are connected
by vast networks,

342
00:18:11,394 --> 00:18:14,615
information flows
across the globe
at the speed of light.

343
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:18,358
My technology is
a tool we need.

344
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,926
The way to reach them
is beyond you.

345
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,232
They are beyond me.

346
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:28,716
But if I can't
feel the presence

347
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,936
of Supergirl
or the Luthor girl on Earth,

348
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,329
then that means...

349
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,378
they're in
the one place on Earth...

350
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,598
that is not of Earth.

351
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,955
Is that a polyphasic
quantum processor?

352
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,131
They've long been theorized,

353
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,133
but I had no idea
one actually existed.

354
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,351
I think it is.

355
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,093
My name is Kara Zor-El.

356
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,444
I seek information on
ancient Earth-bending aliens.

357
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,359
The only alien matching
that description

358
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:06,275
comes from a sister planet
of Krypton, Jarhanpur.

359
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,191
The planet was destroyed
after years of civil wars,

360
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,975
but five of its leaders fled.

361
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,456
One of those leaders
has the extraordinary power

362
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,241
to bend the earth to his will.

363
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,112
How do we stop him?

364
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,331
There are weapons
in the Fortress armory

365
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:19,767
that can wound him.

366
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,812
Weapons thought to
weaken Kryptonians.

367
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,858
Those created by Lex Luthor,

368
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,164
brother of Lena Luthor.

369
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,643
Thank you, that's all we need.

370
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,255
Well, we better get
to the armory.

371
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:30,343
If there are more
of these aliens,

372
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,214
we're gonna need
a really big gun.

373
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,000
We should warn Brainy.

374
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:38,307
-Yeah.
-Do you mind if I do it?

375
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,831
I've never interfaced with
a quantum processor before.

376
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,876
It'd be a bit of a thrill.

377
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,530
Knock yourself out.

378
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:52,582
Done.

379
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:54,715
Let's go.

380
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,419
The only chance
of saving your brother...

381
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:08,816
is to let down
your psychic shield entirely.

382
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:13,777
Open your mind to him
like a flower.

383
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:16,389
Complete vulnerability.

384
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,869
Allow him access
to your memories

385
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:22,264
and innermost thoughts,
so he can see your truth.

386
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,223
If I bond with Malefic...

387
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:28,009
he can choose
to poison my mind.

388
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,274
How can I make that choice
knowing that he will

389
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,407
most likely murder me...

390
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:38,715
and kill everyone I love?

391
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,241
Then retrieve
the Phantom Zone projector,

392
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,243
send him back to isolation.

393
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:45,722
And punish him again?

394
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,290
I'm sorry, my son.

395
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:53,730
In my lifetime,
I faced this test.

396
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:58,126
Should I attempt
to reach Malefic

397
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,260
and risk the utter decimation

398
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,479
of my people, my family,
and myself

399
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:06,047
by his destructive power?

400
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:10,530
Or should I lock him away

401
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:12,445
where he cannot harm others?

402
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:19,626
I made my impossible choice.

403
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:22,498
There is no such thing
as right or wrong.

404
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:24,326
There is only peace
in one's heart,

405
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:27,329
something I never found.

406
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:33,030
The sins of the father
are visited on the son.

407
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,774
You must make
your own choice, J'onn.

408
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:41,082
Then ask H'ronmeer
to guide you to your brother.

409
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,042
No matter what you decide,

410
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,002
I will love you for it.

411
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:53,660
Just as I loved both you
and Malefic...

412
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,532
long ago.

413
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,026
This gun is so tiny.

414
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:15,464
Yeah, Lex designed that
to fit under
his many human hair wigs.

415
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,727
-Ugh!
-So, yeah.

416
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,208
Right, so the computer said
we need to look for something

417
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:22,341
that will hurt Kryptonians.

418
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:23,820
Seems to be a lot
of that in here.

419
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:26,519
What's this?

420
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:29,696
That is Myriad.

421
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,742
My... My family created it.

422
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:35,571
I think I was still
in Metropolis
when Myriad hit.

423
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:37,399
The news footage, though,
it was pretty horrific.

424
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:39,836
And reality was even worse.

425
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,883
My Aunt Astra and her husband
turned all of humanity

426
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:46,016
into mindless zombies
in less than a second.

427
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,542
If there is one weapon
in this room I could destroy,
it would be that one.

428
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,111
Oh, well, this could be
the ticket.

429
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,853
It's a sonic cannon.

430
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:59,508
It sends concentrated
blasts of high-frequency
ultrasonic waves

431
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:00,727
at whatever you aim it at.

432
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,032
With a few slight adjustments,

433
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,034
we can maybe use it
to destabilize Rama Khan.

434
00:23:04,078 --> 00:23:07,908
I mean, at least long enough
to put the power-dampening
cuffs on him.

435
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:10,867
It was designed for evil,
but perhaps we can use it
for some good.

436
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:23,097
...evidence that the
Psions affected the Czarnians'
evolutionary process.

437
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,620
It's obvious.

438
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:26,187
Hydrogen molecules synonymous
with Thanagarian atoms...

439
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:30,104
Good God, it...
It's just...
It's clear!

440
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:33,847
My inhibitor.

441
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,197
Of course.

442
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,504
I'm less inhibited.

443
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:42,072
It's spectacular,

444
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,813
truly and absolutely.

445
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:52,909
Great Scott!

446
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,525
Of course! Tuesday,
croissant... Pilates...
meaning...

447
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,919
Leviathan headquarters
are in National City.

448
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:10,753
You know, I know I said that
I really wanted
to get back to work,

449
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:13,669
but this is so much better.

450
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:14,975
Oh.

451
00:24:15,976 --> 00:24:18,674
Look, I really...

452
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:21,938
appreciate being taken care of.

453
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:24,724
I'm so used to doing
all this by myself.

454
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,509
But being with you, it...

455
00:24:29,293 --> 00:24:30,556
It feels like home.

456
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,647
What's wrong?

457
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,825
When Nia texted me
that you were hurt...

458
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,263
my stomach dropped...

459
00:24:42,306 --> 00:24:45,658
and I checked my phone
for a text, and
there was nothing there,

460
00:24:45,701 --> 00:24:47,964
so I assumed the worst.

461
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,186
Because I've been
through the worst,

462
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:55,145
and this isn't the first time
that I've been terrified.

463
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:57,844
Last week, I thought
that I was gonna lose you.

464
00:24:58,627 --> 00:24:59,976
But then you got me
that helmet,

465
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,762
and you were so wonderful
and so excited.

466
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,635
And so I pushed past my fears,

467
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,509
and I convinced myself
that I can handle it all.

468
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,730
But I'm not that strong.

469
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,732
And I would never
ask you to change

470
00:25:16,776 --> 00:25:19,474
or ask you to
deny the amazing

471
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,737
and brave woman that you are.

472
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,697
Kelly, what--
What are you saying?

473
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,177
I can't.

474
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,179
Leviathan.

475
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,792
I... I think
I have their location.

476
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,011
We must leave immediately.

477
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,582
Go.  Please, go.

478
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,822
This is it?

479
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,563
Choosing an unobtrusive
structure is how Leviathan

480
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,999
keeps their base a secret.

481
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,088
Except from me.

482
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:13,876
I must tell you that
in the wake of the explosion,

483
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,620
it is as if
the peripheral vision
of my mind has expanded.

484
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:22,711
I can now see 20/20
out of the corner of
each metaphorical eye.

485
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:24,887
Which is how I saw,
when examining
Rip Roar's tech,

486
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,802
some peculiar markings
on his headpiece.

487
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,717
When joined together, it formed
a symbol that can be seen

488
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:30,327
countless times
throughout history.

489
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:33,287
A symbol that has been seen
at disasters and catastrophes,

490
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,767
events of mass destruction.

491
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,073
A symbol that has connected
Rama Khan and Leviathan,

492
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:40,076
but also... every Tuesday
before Pilates,

493
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,512
I get a morning tea
and croissant

494
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,689
at a delightful patisserie
right past this building.

495
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,256
Okay, let's just hope
that you are right.

496
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,608
I mean, look. This is
a fact-finding mission,

497
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:53,002
so please just... be cool.

498
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:53,960
I am cool.

499
00:26:54,003 --> 00:26:55,788
You see, I chose
this coffee shop

500
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,833
because of its close proximity
to National City's
ancient tar pits,

501
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,661
a site of great importance
in history, but also

502
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:00,836
a site of terrible eruption.

503
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,925
You see, despite
its sulfuric scent,

504
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:05,493
its emitted energy
boosts my brain function.

505
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:08,627
And I believe Leviathan
has picked this building
for the very same reason.

506
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,106
The ancient energy.

507
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:11,760
Behold...

508
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:16,156
The same symbol appears
on this building's cornerstone.

509
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,070
It's impressive.

510
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:20,116
Not just impressive.

511
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:26,645
Very impressive.

512
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,872
Cloaking tech.

513
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:38,569
In order to eliminate
this barrier,

514
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,223
we'll have to hit it
with something similar
to the creator...

515
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,616
something ancient.

516
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,487
I've got it. The dust
from the majestic tar pits

517
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,489
emits Veridian radiation,

518
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,709
redistributing power, and...

519
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,365
No, no, no.
Don't push it yet!

520
00:27:57,937 --> 00:28:00,417
If this elevator leads to
where you think it's going,

521
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:01,767
we're gonna need Supergirl.

522
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:05,988
Supergirl, we've located
Leviathan.

523
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,295
Great. Send us the coordinates
and we'll come to you.

524
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,297
Okay,
and I'll have the DEO
start a broadband scan ASAP.

525
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,996
Time to go.

526
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,304
Is that...

527
00:28:17,957 --> 00:28:19,306
It is.

528
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,786
Stay here. Get the gun ready.

529
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:38,673
You thought
you could hide her from me?

530
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,285
I am ancient. I am the earth.

531
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,417
What are you?

532
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,948
Me? I'm just peeved
you didn't knock.

533
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:02,523
I don't understand.
Every piece of evidence
led here.

534
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:05,352
At least we know
my security measures
are working.

535
00:29:10,879 --> 00:29:12,272
Let's get out of here.

536
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,942
I told you, I am the earth!

537
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:41,214
"The earth."
But the Fortress
isn't made of earth.

538
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,220
I'm curious,
how did you find us?

539
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:49,613
When I searched
the globe and couldn't
find you,

540
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:52,094
I went to the one place that
I knew that you could hide.

541
00:29:52,138 --> 00:29:53,966
I think
you overlooked something.

542
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:56,490
Oh?

543
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,361
You're in my house.

544
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:59,972
I have home court advantage.

545
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,853
Welcome to Krypton, old man.

546
00:30:25,736 --> 00:30:26,999
Forget about me?

547
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,616
You won't survive me again,
Kryptonian.

548
00:30:45,104 --> 00:30:46,105
Lena?

549
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,324
Lena?

550
00:30:51,327 --> 00:30:52,198
Lena.

551
00:30:57,725 --> 00:30:58,987
Why do you have Myriad?

552
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:05,602
Well, you caught me.

553
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,216
I have Myriad
because I'm using you...

554
00:31:11,565 --> 00:31:12,914
like you used me.

555
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,355
I never used you.

556
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,010
Do you remember
when you finally told me
you were Supergirl?

557
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:25,492
You were weeping.

558
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:28,234
Big crocodile tears.

559
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,194
Well, I wept real tears,

560
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,762
bitter tears over you
weeks before.

561
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:37,896
What? I... I thought...

562
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,379
How long had you known?

563
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:46,948
I found out the day
I killed my brother.

564
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:50,038
Lena, you didn't kill Lex,
that was me.

565
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,606
I... I watched him...

566
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:54,956
I saw him fall.

567
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,653
You saw him fall,
but did you see him land?

568
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,091
Did you see him die?

569
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,399
I did, and let me tell you,
it wasn't pretty.

570
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,184
That's impossible.

571
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:06,707
Anything's possible
when you're a Luthor.

572
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,668
Lex used
his transmatter portal watch.

573
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:14,323
I knew exactly where he'd go.

574
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,021
To the cabin we loved
when we were children,

575
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,848
so I was there waiting for him.

576
00:32:17,892 --> 00:32:20,199
I had the gun ready... loaded.

577
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:22,114
I could feel the weight of it
in my hands.

578
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,988
Every fiber in my being
rebelled, but I--

579
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,424
I didn't want to do it,
but I knew I had to

580
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:31,645
because if Lex lived,
the world wouldn't be safe,

581
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,038
my friends wouldn't be safe.

582
00:32:33,081 --> 00:32:35,605
So I forced myself
to pull the trigger.

583
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,088
I shot my own brother
in the chest.

584
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:44,527
His final words to me were...

585
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:46,790
that I was a fool,

586
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:51,839
that my best friend,
that every friend I had
was lying to me.

587
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:55,495
With his dying breath,
he told me that
you were Supergirl.

588
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:58,324
Lena, you have to believe me,

589
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,239
I never meant to humiliate you.

590
00:33:00,282 --> 00:33:03,285
No. When I came to this city,

591
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:06,332
I promised myself that
I would never trust
anyone again, and...

592
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,510
then I met you.

593
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,817
You chipped away at my armor
with your warmth
and your earnestness,

594
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:17,386
and you convinced me to trust
in people and friendship again,

595
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,650
and against my better judgment,
I did,

596
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:23,479
all the while telling you
about my Achilles heel...

597
00:33:25,351 --> 00:33:26,439
betrayal.

598
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:29,790
I confided in you

599
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:32,358
that everyone in my past
had betrayed me.

600
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:36,188
About how much it hurt...

601
00:33:36,971 --> 00:33:38,842
to have someone you love

602
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:40,366
lie to you and betray you.

603
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,326
I spelled it out
to you over and over again,

604
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:47,068
essentially begging you
not to violate my trust,

605
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:50,028
begging you not to prove that,
once again, I was a fool.

606
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,074
You reassured me ad nauseam

607
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,554
that you would never lie to me,

608
00:33:54,597 --> 00:33:56,512
that you'd never hurt me.

609
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,907
And all the while,
there wasn't a single

610
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,300
honest moment
in our friendship--

611
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,041
No! No, that is not true--

612
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:05,565
No! I killed my brother
for you, for our friends!

613
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,741
Don't you understand
what you've done?

614
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,187
When you found out,
why didn't you come...
to me right away,

615
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:20,710
so I could explain--

616
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,408
"Explain"? Yeah?

617
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,976
If you hate me so much, why...

618
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,109
Why not out me
at the Pulitzer party?

619
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,332
Why pretend to still be
my friend this long?

620
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:36,335
Because I wanted you
to experience
what you did to me.

621
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,426
Feel what I felt.

622
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,827
I understand your pain
and your fury and...

623
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,265
And you're right.

624
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:55,180
I made a big mistake,

625
00:34:55,223 --> 00:34:58,574
maybe the biggest mistake
of my life, but please...

626
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:01,099
Lena, please don't leave
the Fortress with Myriad.

627
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:04,189
Please don't let my mistake
push you to do
something terrible.

628
00:35:04,232 --> 00:35:06,756
-You are a good person.
-No!

629
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,325
No, you don't ever get
to tell me who
or what I am again.

630
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:12,284
Intruder! Intruder!

631
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:20,422
Did you reprogram
the Fortress defenses
to attack me?

632
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,554
Yes.

633
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,299
And I rigged it to answer
to this little button
I have in my hand.

634
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:31,607
Are you going to try
to kill me?

635
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:35,698
No. Supergirl,
I'm not gonna kill you.

636
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,661
I'm not a villain.

637
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,622
You shouldn't have
treated me like one.

638
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:03,335
And now you've come
to finish what you started?

639
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,251
I have.

640
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:25,792
But I will not...

641
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,838
send you back
to the Phantom Zone, brother.

642
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:31,667
I spent lifetimes there,
brother.

643
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:35,758
Lifetimes of nothing.

644
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,675
No air, no time,

645
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,199
no sight, no smell.

646
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:44,202
Nothing but my heart...

647
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,248
suspended mid-beat.

648
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:53,298
An excruciating suspense
that never stops.

649
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:57,780
A breath you can never exhale.

650
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:04,265
Is that where you suggest
I send you?

651
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,745
You can if you wish.

652
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,968
But I bring this only now
as an offering...

653
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,668
to show you

654
00:37:15,711 --> 00:37:18,627
that I mean it when I say
that I have come here...

655
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,413
to make amends.

656
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:24,590
Liar!

657
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,028
Mal,

658
00:37:28,071 --> 00:37:31,858
I wish I could've
broken you out of that cave
when we were children.

659
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:34,948
Found some way to...

660
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,255
show you.

661
00:37:38,343 --> 00:37:40,562
you were my brother
and I loved you!

662
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:44,871
You didn't love me.

663
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,743
You were ashamed of me.

664
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,616
You hid me away.

665
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:52,966
Banished me...

666
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:55,055
like a monster!

667
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:58,885
We were afraid of you.

668
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,062
We were all afraid of you.

669
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,675
I was afraid of you.

670
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,636
And we were so wrong.

671
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,423
I destroyed my honor...

672
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,643
when I wiped you
from our memories.

673
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:22,212
But, Mal, what I did,
I did for love.

674
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,910
Now that I remember...

675
00:38:25,694 --> 00:38:28,044
I cannot live with this pain.

676
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,656
And so, brother...

677
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,573
I beg your forgiveness

678
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:37,924
by submitting myself...

679
00:38:39,055 --> 00:38:40,318
to the bond.

680
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,453
Look into my mind, brother.

681
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,368
It's that easy?

682
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,546
You hand yourself over to me.

683
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:58,858
I will look...
with pleasure, brother.

684
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:02,818
Right before I kill you.

685
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,734
I'm willing
to risk everything...

686
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:09,651
in order for you
to see my truth,

687
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:13,568
my heart, my soul, and my mind.

688
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,725
I saw.

689
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:00,093
-Hey.
-Hi.

690
00:40:01,747 --> 00:40:03,879
-I was--
-No, it's... I know.

691
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:06,795
Um...

692
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,104
You have been through

693
00:40:11,147 --> 00:40:13,106
an unbearable experience.

694
00:40:13,933 --> 00:40:15,021
Yeah.

695
00:40:15,064 --> 00:40:17,850
You lost your fiancee,
and I can't even

696
00:40:17,893 --> 00:40:21,462
begin to imagine losing
someone that you love...

697
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,595
in that way.

698
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:28,904
You're just so strong

699
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:31,994
that I didn't...
I didn't realize
that you were still suffering,

700
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:35,433
and I'm really sorry that
I wasn't more sensitive
to that.

701
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:37,217
-No, don't--
-Just... Just...

702
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,436
Listen...

703
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,875
When you met me,

704
00:40:43,615 --> 00:40:45,181
I was just half a person.

705
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,229
I was still hurting
from my own wounds

706
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:52,798
and you... You helped me heal.

707
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:55,714
You know, from wounds to scars,

708
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,498
to just memories.

709
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,764
That's... That's all I want
to do for you.

710
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:07,552
Hey, I want to help you heal.

711
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:09,554
I want to be with you

712
00:41:09,597 --> 00:41:12,339
and face down your fears
and do it together.

713
00:41:12,382 --> 00:41:15,168
I want to help you heal.

714
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:18,084
And what if that's
not possible?

715
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:21,696
Well, I know that it is.

716
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:23,655
How?

717
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:25,831
Because you healed me.

718
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:30,923
I meant it when I said
that you feel like home.

719
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,535
You feel like home, too.
