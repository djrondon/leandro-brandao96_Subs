1
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:02,915
Previously
onSupergirl...

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,700
The shrinking and collection
of worlds

3
00:00:04,743 --> 00:00:06,528
is a common practice
among our ancestors.

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,878
William and I discovered
thatEve Tessmacher

5
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:10,619
has been working
for Obsidian.

6
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,448
If you're going to be
a vigilante,

7
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,580
maybe you should get
better at hiding.

8
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,104
What do you mean, like,
wear a mask?

9
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:18,888
I don't know who
this Brainy is.

10
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:20,629
But I know I don't trust him.

11
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,500
Andrea knows nothing.

12
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:25,025
Seems on this Earth,
post-Crisis, Leviathan
hasn't activated her yet.

13
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,852
Gemma Cooper
is warming to me.

14
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,593
And when she sees
my newest present,

15
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,247
she'll roll out the red carpet.

16
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:32,902
And if that means helping them
get a weapon or two, so be it.

17
00:00:32,945 --> 00:00:34,251
You know what
this weapon is,

18
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,079
so you know what it needs.

19
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,211
Get it for me.

20
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,126
And this time, do not fail.

21
00:00:41,084 --> 00:00:43,956
Regarding your request
to meet my colleagues,

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,610
I'll send you a car
tomorrow morning.

23
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:46,916
See you tomorrow.

24
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,266
I have made
a terrible mistake.

25
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,442
Lex is working with Leviathan,

26
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:54,837
and they are going
to use Obsidian to do
something terrible.

27
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,621
I want to help
stop them.

28
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,364
An elevator?

29
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,714
Seems a little pedestrian
for a goddess of technology.

30
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,284
Welcome to Leviathan.

31
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,033
You know...

32
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,469
I pride myself

33
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:20,254
on seeing things.

34
00:01:20,297 --> 00:01:24,127
Connections where others
see only coincidence.

35
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:26,521
Pathways where others
see only walls.

36
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:28,305
I anticipate everything.

37
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:29,611
But I must admit,

38
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:32,222
I didn't not except you
to live in a casino.

39
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:41,318
After you.

40
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:44,887
One small step from that--

41
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,239
Lex Luthor.

42
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:50,762
The fabled man of tomorrow.

43
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:53,113
At least you have the decency
to bow before the gods.

44
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:55,115
I told you to disable
the shields.

45
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,160
As long as he knows
where we live it stays on.

46
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,770
At all times.

47
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:00,598
-On whose orders?
-Whose do you think?

48
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,645
-The ship's defense mechanism.

49
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,603
A proto-focused
radiation shield.

50
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:08,215
This pin will protect you.

51
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:10,782
Wow, you really know how to
make your guests feel welcome.

52
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,525
Well now the, uh...

53
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:15,874
...pleasantries are
out of the way,

54
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,355
don't you think we
should discuss our plan

55
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,922
to take out Supergirl
and her friends?

56
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:23,273
These rings

57
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,015
bought you a ticket to
board our ship.

58
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,235
So enjoy your photo op.

59
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,499
But leave the slaughter
of Supergirl to us.

60
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:56,437
Thank you for
letting me in, Kara.

61
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:01,137
It's been a year
and I still haven't come to
terms with what I did.

62
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,052
Shot my brother and...

63
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,229
I mean, I thought I was
protecting everyone

64
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,404
but it really started
all that--

65
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,319
I don't want to talk
about the past.

66
00:03:10,581 --> 00:03:12,017
All that matters now is

67
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,802
the threat ahead of us and how
we are going to stop it.

68
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,196
Understood.

69
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,590
Get down on the ground, now.

70
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,591
No, Alex, no.

71
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:21,853
You texted 911.

72
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:22,941
Not about her.

73
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:25,335
She's here to help
us stop Lex.

74
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,467
And Leviathan.

75
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,774
Oh.

76
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,863
So Lex and Leviathan
are planning something

77
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:34,126
using Obsidian virtual
reality platform.

78
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,738
And my tech likely made
that possible.

79
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,828
That must be why
Rama Khan went after the
DEO's Kryptonite.

80
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,612
To keep Supergirl from
interfering.

81
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:42,918
Well, the joke's on Rama Khan

82
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,876
and his big dumb
gladiator outfit.

83
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,574
Because I have already
defeated him once.

84
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:47,923
Don't be rash, Kara.

85
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,664
He's tied to the Earth.

86
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,970
Which means he can track
your slightest movements.

87
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,711
If you use your powers
even once,

88
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:55,452
he will sense them,

89
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,541
and attack.

90
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,456
With all that
Kryptonite at his fingertips,

91
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,805
he could kill you.

92
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,720
You guys will protect me.

93
00:04:02,764 --> 00:04:04,374
Just like we protected the DEO?

94
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:09,510
It's not checkmate.

95
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,164
Not yet.

96
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,732
I haven't made Kara
an anti-Kryptonite suit
in this world.

97
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:15,864
But I could.

98
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,474
Just need to get you
safely to my lab.

99
00:04:17,518 --> 00:04:19,171
Your lab is across
the city.

100
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,173
And Kara can't use her powers.

101
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,567
We could get her there.

102
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:25,177
If we had the right
distraction.

103
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,789
Or the right decoys.

104
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,923
No, no, no way.

105
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,011
Absolutely not.

106
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,057
I can tell those pants
will chafe.

107
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,149
Ugh!
I was right.

108
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,152
I quite like it.

109
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:45,502
This is just like
the beginning
of Deathly Hallows.

110
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,330
Moody and Hedwig died.

111
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,940
You lost
comrades in battle?

112
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,028
My condolences.

113
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:51,987
No, it's...

114
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,989
Dreamer and
I will draw Rama Khan out in
Courtney Park.

115
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,513
M'gann, Alex,

116
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,820
you move across the rooftops
to cover us.

117
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:00,691
While they're distracting
Leviathan,

118
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,432
you and I will make our way
to LuthorCorp.

119
00:05:02,476 --> 00:05:03,303
Come here.

120
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,915
I have to show you something.

121
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:07,872
Okay. Stay right there.

122
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,795
Oh, my God.

123
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,883
J'onn made it for me.

124
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:23,148
She looks great.

125
00:05:23,192 --> 00:05:26,543
Oh, it was
a scream of delight.

126
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:27,805
Thank H'ronmeer.

127
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:33,942
Well, we should probably
get going.

128
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:36,945
Stay safe out there.

129
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,644
I know that may not
have been the most

130
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,385
pleasant experience.

131
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,518
But Rama Khan was just
trying to protect the base.

132
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,998
Not only Ram Khan, it seems.

133
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,349
And here I was thinking you
were the top of the food chain.

134
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:52,874
I answer to another.

135
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:55,572
Took me a long time
to gain her trust.

136
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:58,227
Which is why the Unity
Festival must succeed.

137
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,402
I'm yours.

138
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,316
Whatever you need.

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,230
Keep it.

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,102
You've earned it.

141
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,365
That's why I brought
you to the ship.

142
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,802
You're one of us now.

143
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:12,894
Today is the last day
of the old era.

144
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,984
Tomorrow the future begins.

145
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,397
Did you get
the ship's location?

146
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,528
Indeed.

147
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:41,009
But it has a nasty
defense mechanism.

148
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,663
They gave me something
to protect from it.

149
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:45,361
Give it to me.

150
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,145
Not yet.

151
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:49,321
We've come all this way...

152
00:06:49,365 --> 00:06:51,019
We have done all
those terrible things,

153
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:52,716
so that I can sneak up
aboard the Leviathan ship

154
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,110
and upload the mortality
code, so that I can kill
the immortals.

155
00:06:55,153 --> 00:06:56,546
And we shall.

156
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,506
But first, Rama Khan and his
element-bending goons

157
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,160
need to eliminate Supergirl's
friends one by one.

158
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,815
And when she
has nothing left...

159
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,427
they'll slay her, too.

160
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,385
After that you kill the gods.

161
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,474
You think I'm just
gonna sit back

162
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:13,607
while Leviathan murders
my friends?

163
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,651
Former friends.

164
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:16,653
And yes, I think you will.

165
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,263
Because if you get on
that ship any sooner,

166
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:19,308
you'll die with them.

167
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,401
Leviathan
is the enemy, Lex.

168
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,708
Not Supergirl,
not J'onn J'onzz.

169
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,840
-Not Dreamer.
-You're right.

170
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,147
They're heroes.

171
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,454
They would happily sacrifice
themselves to save the world.

172
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,847
Maybe they'll even thank us.

173
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:47,118
There's no place
I can't find you.

174
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,293
That's where you're wrong.

175
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,039
M'gann you're off the hook.

176
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,171
We've got Rama Khan.

177
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:57,041
Copy that.

178
00:07:57,825 --> 00:07:58,826
We're on our way.

179
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,397
Wait.

180
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,748
There's someone else.

181
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,359
Another element bender.

182
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:25,983
Gotcha!

183
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,470
There's more than
one of us, too.

184
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,782
Kara, we got her.

185
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:56,666
Kara, come on, we've gotta go.

186
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:18,906
Dreamer.

187
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,168
Dreamer, what happened?

188
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,694
J'onn, no.

189
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,785
Go. Go, go, go.

190
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,673
The suit won't be ready for
at least another few hours.

191
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,849
But I'm doing everything in my
power to speed it along.

192
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,547
Hey.

193
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,592
What happened?

194
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:53,767
It's just not Rama Khan
out there.

195
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,246
There's three of them.

196
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,987
Each with different
element-bending power.

197
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:57,858
Where are the others?

198
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:01,078
J'onn was injured.

199
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,776
M'gann and Dreamer
are taken back to the tower.

200
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:03,864
I should have been there,

201
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,517
fighting alongside
you, I'm sorry.

202
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,780
Kara, it's okay.

203
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,477
We all still have our ears.

204
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:13,047
Kelly, hey.

205
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,570
Oh, thank God
I got you.

206
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,006
William texted me last night,

207
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,139
that he was going after
Eve Tessmacher.

208
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,881
I haven't been able to
reach him since.

209
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,622
William went after Eve alone?

210
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:23,666
No super-hearings.

211
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,059
-Sorry.
-Eve Tessmacher?

212
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,714
She's back?

213
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,020
Look, I'll get to you as
soon as I can.

214
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,240
Hey, if this Eve is
working with Lex,

215
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,198
William has no idea
the danger he is in.

216
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:35,286
I...

217
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,853
Alex, I have to do something.

218
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:38,855
I can't just sit here.
I have to help him,

219
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,683
-somehow.
-Okay, listen to me. Stop.

220
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:43,991
I know how hard it is for you
to sit on the sidelines.

221
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,558
Okay, but Kelly and I,
we will handle this.

222
00:10:46,602 --> 00:10:49,387
We will access Eve's files
at Obsidian North

223
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,693
and we'll see what she's up to.

224
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,826
And if she has gotten
to William, hey.

225
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,742
We will find him.

226
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,658
You just need to stay safe
until Lena finishes your suit.

227
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,879
Okay, all right, fine.

228
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,229
But please, be careful.

229
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,144
You know me.

230
00:11:07,188 --> 00:11:08,624
Yeah, exactly,
that's what I'm worried about.

231
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,321
Come on

232
00:11:13,455 --> 00:11:15,065
Satellite uplink
is nearly ready.

233
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,677
We should launch.

234
00:11:21,202 --> 00:11:22,029
Gemma?

235
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,515
I was communicating with her.

236
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,562
-The news isn't good.
-What is it?

237
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:36,173
Tezumak managed to
injure one of the Martians.

238
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,522
But Supergirl never even joined

239
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,742
the fight and the others
got away.

240
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,136
I've gambled everything on
this Unity Festival.

241
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,791
Then we have to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

242
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,097
Lex, Gemma...

243
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:48,664
It's time.

244
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:53,974
So?

245
00:11:55,323 --> 00:11:57,325
Shall we begin ending
the world?

246
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,552
Al's dive bar?

247
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,685
This is where you summoned
me at a time like this?

248
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,992
It's the place where you first
gave me this mission.

249
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:14,429
Work with Lex Luthor.

250
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,518
Defeat Leviathan.

251
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:18,825
No matter the cost.

252
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:24,004
Today I will feel the full
extent of that cost.

253
00:12:25,005 --> 00:12:26,397
Querl.

254
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:28,182
I know things
spun out of control

255
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:30,184
last time you disobeyed Lex.

256
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:32,273
But you don't have to do this.

257
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,318
You don't have to let
your friends die.

258
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,931
I don't plan to.

259
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:41,151
I don't plan on using Lex's
mortality code on the gods,
either.

260
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:44,285
But how will you defeat them?

261
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:49,551
By using this.

262
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:54,991
Rather than kill the gods.

263
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:57,646
And I shall reclaim
the actions of our ancestors.

264
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,735
For good.

265
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,084
Instead of evil.

266
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:02,782
I'll shrink them.

267
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:05,915
I'll bottle them
here in stasis,

268
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:08,048
where they can harm neither
this planet nor my friends.

269
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,792
But if you enter the ship

270
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,969
without Lex's
anti-radiation pin, you'll...

271
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,755
You'll... You'll die.

272
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:25,979
I pushed away everyone I loved

273
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,502
because you told me I must.

274
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,026
You were right.

275
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,289
This planet...

276
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:33,813
my friends...

277
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,076
It's worth it.

278
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,995
I called you here
simply because...

279
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,261
I don't wanna die alone.

280
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,617
Citizens of the world.

281
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,533
Today we stand on the
precipice of history.

282
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:01,405
Ours is a world of pain,
suffering.

283
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:04,017
Of conflict, of chaos.

284
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,584
But when you enter
Obsidian's world...

285
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,718
The problems of the real
one melt away.

286
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,677
In virtual reality, there is
nothing to want.

287
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:14,897
No reason to harm one another.

288
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:17,987
It's a place where we can be
our best and truest selves.

289
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,035
This world can be
our real world.

290
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:24,907
And it all starts today.

291
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:27,649
With the Obsidian
Worldwide Unity Festival.

292
00:14:58,462 --> 00:14:59,507
Oh, nice.

293
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,161
Did someone call for
tech support?

294
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:06,775
I just said a mask, but...

295
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,604
Wow.

296
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:11,475
Bummer we have to get to
straight to business.

297
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,261
Yeah, I guess you inspired me.

298
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,958
I could have never
gotten past security.

299
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,178
My girlfriend's a badass.

300
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,832
Breaking into a tech
corps, that's easy.

301
00:15:20,876 --> 00:15:22,530
What I battled earlier today...

302
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:24,706
These are gods.

303
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,752
I mean, I finally got
this baby working.

304
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,059
But compared to what those
guys are packing...

305
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,539
I might as well have brought
a slingshot.

306
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,934
I've never felt so human.

307
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,242
Oh, wait, wait,
we got something.

308
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,418
Eve's IP address.

309
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:42,811
-Okay.
-Wait.

310
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:43,899
It's encrypted.

311
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,856
Better call Lena.

312
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,426
These programs should
be able to crack Eve's cipher
in minutes.

313
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,561
Talk about history
repeating itself.

314
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:54,910
Tracking Lex down
through Eve...

315
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:56,912
It's just like Kaznia.

316
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,918
Please, Kara, I'm sorry.

317
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,007
Okay, I truly believed what I
was doing was helping people.

318
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:08,010
I told you I don't want
to talk about the past.

319
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,794
Oh, come on, you can scream
at me if you'd like.

320
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:11,927
I know I deserve it.

321
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,929
I know now that working
with Non Nocere was a mistake,
that working with Lex--

322
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,104
This isn't about Lex.

323
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:17,933
This is about J'onn and Alex

324
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,804
and all the other people that
could have been killed today

325
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:21,719
because they are on my team.

326
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,894
Don't you understand that?

327
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,331
No, I do, of course I do.

328
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,288
No you don't.

329
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,724
You have never understood

330
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:28,813
what it means share a secret
identity with someone.

331
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,598
How much danger
that puts them in.

332
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,730
You... You never
even understood

333
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:36,082
that I kept my identity
from you because I wanted
to protect you.

334
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:39,737
I know, I know

335
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,391
that I hurt you

336
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:44,046
by waiting so long
to tell my truth.

337
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,440
But what about all
the ways you hurt me?

338
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:50,879
You pretended to be my
friend for weeks.

339
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,794
Just so you could
manipulate me.

340
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:54,535
You stole from me.

341
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,493
You convinced me to
steal for you.

342
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,800
And then, then, you even...

343
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:01,759
You used Kryptonite on me.

344
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,025
I made one mistake.

345
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,505
One mistake

346
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,725
that was only ever meant
to protect you.

347
00:17:10,768 --> 00:17:12,074
And in return,

348
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,469
all you did was hurt me
in every way imaginable.

349
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,258
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,129
I know you are.

351
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:27,655
But if you came to me looking
for absolution,

352
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:29,483
I can't give it to you.

353
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,402
It's Eve's location.

354
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,187
I'm going.

355
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:39,275
No, Kara, your suit
isn't ready yet.

356
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,450
I don't care.

357
00:17:40,494 --> 00:17:42,278
Protecting people is what I do.

358
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:43,366
You should know that by now.

359
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,891
Then I'm going with you.

360
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,632
Now that you're up,
you better start talking.

361
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:51,026
Why were you following me?

362
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,508
I'm pursuing a story
on Lex Luthor.

363
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,423
I know he is up to something
criminal.

364
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:59,121
I don't know your
involvement.

365
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,080
But I believe you've been
working for him.

366
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,386
You have no idea what
you have gotten yourself into.

367
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,909
You should have
stayed out of it.

368
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,085
Now I have no choice.

369
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:11,307
I'm a journalist.

370
00:18:11,351 --> 00:18:13,266
Okay, I can read people.

371
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:15,877
You're a good person who
looks trapped.

372
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:18,749
It's clear you're not
a killer.

373
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,665
What does he have with you?

374
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:24,364
Did he threaten someone
you care about?

375
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:29,717
My mother.

376
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:36,506
I am so sorry.

377
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,942
But you don't have
to fight this alone.

378
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,815
I can help you
and your mother.

379
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:45,733
We can bring
the truth to light.

380
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,433
If the truth comes to light,
my mother is dead.

381
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,350
Eve, please.

382
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,917
I really am so sorry.

383
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,362
It's okay. I've got you.

384
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,674
Okay. The bullet went
through and through

385
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,415
through but we still need to
get you to a hospital.

386
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,373
No, no, no,
he's losing to much blood.
There's no time.

387
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:19,158
Okay.

388
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,420
I can cauterize it but it's
gonna hurt.

389
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:22,030
-Do it, do it.
-All right.

390
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,119
Don't do it.

391
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,729
Too late, too late. It's done.

392
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:27,035
-You okay?

393
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,559
Yes, it just hurt.

394
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,040
All right,
what happened here?

395
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,259
I was following a lead.

396
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,086
Got jumped.

397
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:38,046
Ah, Reporting 101.

398
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,918
If you get kidnapped,
you must be on the right track.

399
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,138
-Something Kara Danvers
likes to say.

400
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:45,619
She was working the case
with me.

401
00:19:45,662 --> 00:19:47,403
I need to make sure
she is all right.

402
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,318
Kara is fine.

403
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:50,885
I spoke to her,
she's in a safe place.

404
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,942
Get William and Eve
out of here.

405
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,074
I'll deal with this.

406
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:07,467
Are you mad?
They've got Kryptonite.

407
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,033
Well, then you'd better get
that suit here fast.

408
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,252
It's already on its way.

409
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,340
And I'll call for back-up.

410
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,607
Kill her.

411
00:20:44,721 --> 00:20:46,201
Did someone call
for backup?

412
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,899
Now it's a fair fight.

413
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,641
Couldn't let you have
all the fun.

414
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,122
Can't believe you
left to play earth, wind and
fire without us.

415
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,143
They're...

416
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:17,145
They're gone.

417
00:21:17,188 --> 00:21:18,277
The explosion killed them.

418
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,285
We have to get out of here.

419
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:27,155
Now.

420
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,889
Let's replenish ourselves and
finish this once and for all.

421
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:13,767
That's when their bodies
started to reform like
out of a horror movie.

422
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:14,811
Yeah, but that means...

423
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:16,117
They're indestructible.

424
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,161
Immortal.

425
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,775
This isn't about defeating
them anymore.

426
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,213
They want us to fight
until we drop.

427
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:28,085
So they can distract us from
whatever Lex is planning.

428
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:29,260
Do we even know what that is?

429
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:31,306
I'm gonna go find out.

430
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:33,308
Eve.

431
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,789
Eve, can you hear me?

432
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,622
-Is the reporter okay?
-Yes.

433
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:44,275
He told us everything.

434
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,148
Please understand...

435
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,455
I was just trying to protect
my mom.

436
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:52,893
Now Lex is gonna kill her.

437
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,199
I know you must feel
like there is no way out.

438
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,594
But it is when things feel
their most hopeless

439
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:00,161
that we have to dig down deep

440
00:23:00,204 --> 00:23:01,162
to do what is right.

441
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:04,339
Otherwise the bad guys win.

442
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:05,993
Help us, Eve.

443
00:23:07,124 --> 00:23:09,170
Help us fight.

444
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:12,478
And I promise I will do
everything in my power to keep
you and your mom safe.

445
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,312
Gemma Cooper is not
who she says she is.

446
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:25,447
Her real name is Gamemnae.

447
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:29,451
She is a member of Leviathan,
just like Rama Khan.

448
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,846
Tonight they are planning
to attack the Unity Festival.

449
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,935
Once all four million
subscribers are inside...

450
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,590
Gemma will kill them all.

451
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,513
I recommend the chocos.

452
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:49,515
How's J'onn?

453
00:23:50,385 --> 00:23:51,212
Recovering.

454
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,562
You can't fool a sidekick.

455
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,173
I saw you hesitate
during the fight.

456
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:57,218
You dreamed something.

457
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,351
And it terrified you.

458
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:01,222
What did you see?

459
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:04,486
Brainy.

460
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,792
You two were couple, right?

461
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,492
You know J'onn.

462
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:12,363
For a deeply serious man,
he's got a big mouth.

463
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:14,235
I know.

464
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,501
It was more than
a relationship.

465
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,330
We were partners.

466
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,506
We...

467
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,334
protected each other.

468
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:29,206
Turns out that one thing I
couldn't protect him from
was himself.

469
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,211
I told him to take
off those inhibitors.

470
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,738
Maybe these dreams
are because of my guilt.

471
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:42,611
There may be more to what he's
going through than you know.

472
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,396
When J'onn discovered
that I was a White Martian.

473
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,094
He thought the worst of me.

474
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,620
Until he finally saw my soul.

475
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:52,882
I'm not a telepath.

476
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,580
No, you're a dreamer.

477
00:24:55,406 --> 00:24:56,538
And like it or not,

478
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,539
you're dreaming now.

479
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,106
You have to engage with it.

480
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:02,588
It could have meaning
far deeper

481
00:25:03,327 --> 00:25:04,938
than you realize.

482
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:06,940
I'm sorry M'gann, I need to be
keeping Brainy out of my mind,

483
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,071
not letting him in.

484
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:13,947
There is nearly
a billion people logged into
the Unity Fest already.

485
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,165
Can we shut down
the system?

486
00:25:15,209 --> 00:25:16,558
Or destroy it somehow?

487
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,125
No.

488
00:25:18,168 --> 00:25:20,649
The Luthor power core
has an indestructible
fail safe.

489
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:24,087
So, you're saying
we need to convince potentially
billions of people

490
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:28,222
to log out of virtual
reality paradise of their
own free will.

491
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,659
Hope you've got one of those
classic hope speeches handy.

492
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,010
I mean, I've done it before
but never on this level.

493
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,534
Oh, if anyone can do it,
it's you.

494
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:39,363
Jinx.

495
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:41,452
All right, so what do we
do about Leviathan?

496
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,585
We'll fight till
our last breath.

497
00:25:43,629 --> 00:25:46,022
J'onn, are you sure?

498
00:25:46,066 --> 00:25:48,416
With you by my side, 100%.

499
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,505
Well, we'll need
to do something to drive
Leviathan out.

500
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,247
I'll send them a message.

501
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,118
-What are you going to say?
-Something to get
their attention.

502
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,430
That arrogant Martian thinks
he can speak to me like that?

503
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:03,736
I'm a god!

504
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:09,002
Once we're done with
this world, I'll turn to
Mars next.

505
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:18,664
Now's your chance.

506
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,255
Place your hand on
the central terminal.

507
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:46,909
You'll be able to upload
the shrink code.

508
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,970
Now you can't
move your hand or else you
have to start over.

509
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,544
The upload will take
ten minutes.

510
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,199
I don't know if I can
last that long.

511
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,548
You can.

512
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:18,811
I'll be with you
the whole way.

513
00:27:29,473 --> 00:27:31,606
Kelly opened
the back door
into the festival.

514
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,129
It should help protect you
from the kill switch.

515
00:27:33,173 --> 00:27:34,435
Hopefully we get everyone out

516
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,610
before Lex and Gemma hit it.

517
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,480
You will.

518
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:40,833
Let's do this.

519
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:46,882
Wow.

520
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:50,233
This is amazing.

521
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,541
I've never seen
anything like this.

522
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,023
No wonder so many people
signed up.

523
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:12,212
There's still no
sign of them.

524
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:13,430
Guess they didn't
take the bait.

525
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,824
Maybe you should have
been meaner.

526
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:19,785
Ah...

527
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:22,701
-No.

528
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,748
I was just mean enough.

529
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:34,147
What? No Supergirl?

530
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,975
Let's see if we can't
convince her to join us.

531
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,503
- What's wrong?
-Supergirl.

532
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,854
She's inside
the Unity Festival.

533
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,726
We need to hit
the kill switch.

534
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,292
Wipe out as many people
as possible.

535
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,641
before she has a chance
to interfere.

536
00:28:50,685 --> 00:28:52,556
There aren't any enough
people logged in yet.

537
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,428
We need to get 50% saturation.

538
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:57,170
What good is wiping out
one quarter of the world

539
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,867
if the other three quarters
rise up against us.

540
00:28:58,911 --> 00:29:00,608
We'll worry about that
problem tomorrow.

541
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:02,131
This is about tomorrow.

542
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,917
You told me you answer
to a higher power.

543
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:07,006
How will she feel

544
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,225
when you give in on
the mission before
it's complete?

545
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:15,057
And if Supergirl is in
the Unity festival,

546
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,146
then her physical body
is vulnerable.

547
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,279
Rama Khan, Tezumak and Sela

548
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:20,802
might be able to
make it back in time.

549
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,499
They need to take out
Supergirl's friends.

550
00:29:22,543 --> 00:29:24,110
Then what do you propose?

551
00:29:24,153 --> 00:29:25,415
Send another assassin.

552
00:29:26,416 --> 00:29:28,201
Someone who won't fail you.

553
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,816
Hi.

554
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,212
We are nearing
two billion simultaneous users.

555
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:41,475
Our dreams are finally
a reality.

556
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,521
Not just our dreams, Andrea.

557
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:45,827
Your father's.

558
00:29:45,871 --> 00:29:46,741
Hm.

559
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:48,874
And Leviathan's.

560
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:52,747
Leviathan?

561
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:54,836
How do you know that name?

562
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,751
Because I am Leviathan.

563
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:01,930
What does that mean?

564
00:30:01,974 --> 00:30:04,672
All I know is that Leviathan
rescued me that day
in the cave.

565
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:07,370
It was I who rescued you.

566
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:09,895
And I have been looking
out for you every day since.

567
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:14,073
But now I need your help.

568
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,466
Yes.

569
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,859
Yes, of course, anything.

570
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,643
There is great power in you.

571
00:30:21,602 --> 00:30:22,690
I know you feel it.

572
00:30:23,473 --> 00:30:24,997
The power of shadows.

573
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,522
I need you to use that power...

574
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:31,873
to kill Supergirl.

575
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:34,615
What?

576
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,226
No. I don't...

577
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:39,315
I can't.

578
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,316
Yes, you can.

579
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,928
And when you do,

580
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:46,148
you'll have power beyond
your wildest dreams.

581
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:48,237
And your company
will be untouchable.

582
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:52,372
If you don't,

583
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,461
your company will collapse.

584
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,723
You will lose everything.

585
00:30:59,292 --> 00:31:00,946
Your father will be crushed.

586
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:05,211
We both know he won't be
able to survive the blow.

587
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:15,264
Everyone listen to me.

588
00:31:15,308 --> 00:31:17,266
There is something wrong
with the program.

589
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,573
You need to end
the simulation now.

590
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,096
What are you
talking about?

591
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:24,230
There is no one in here but
my late husband.

592
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:27,059
It's so good to hear his voice.

593
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:29,713
Hey. Hey, kid.

594
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:32,978
Kid, can you hear me?

595
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:35,110
You need to disengage
from the program.

596
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:36,546
Leave me alone.

597
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,721
My mom is back.

598
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,158
I missed her.

599
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:41,029
It's...

600
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,901
It's not working.

601
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,860
There are too many people,
they feel connected to their
loved ones.

602
00:31:46,643 --> 00:31:47,906
It's spiritual.

603
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,690
I have no idea how to
break through to them.

604
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:51,561
I think I can give you a way
to talk to everyone at once.

605
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:52,867
-Try now.

606
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:57,393
I need
you all to listen to me.

607
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,481
You're in danger.

608
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,882
If you and I fan out to the
side we can draw their fire.

609
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,623
While you two attack
through the middle.

610
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,668
-Sound good?
-Why not?

611
00:32:11,712 --> 00:32:13,322
-You ready?
-Nope.

612
00:32:13,366 --> 00:32:14,193
Me neither.

613
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:15,585
Let's go.

614
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:43,178
Five more minutes.

615
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,225
Stay focused.

616
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:02,937
Andrea.

617
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:04,808
The medallion.

618
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,855
You've been activated.

619
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,553
If I don't kill Supergirl,
they'll kill my father.

620
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:13,295
I know it can be addictive,

621
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:15,689
to live in a perfect place
where nothing hurts.

622
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,213
But that's not reality.

623
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:19,171
Killing for them...

624
00:33:20,737 --> 00:33:22,957
Going down this path,
it won't keep him safe.

625
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:24,828
How do you know?

626
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,091
Because I've been down
it before.

627
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:28,136
We all get hurt.

628
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,486
But it's only by going
through that pain

629
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,706
that we're able to appreciate
the good.

630
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,926
Pain is what helps us grow.

631
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,624
Without it, we'd never
be able to...

632
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:41,454
To evolve, to overcome.

633
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:45,588
To forgive.

634
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:47,982
I have done terrible things

635
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
to protect myself and
the people I love.

636
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:52,204
But it has never kept
me safe from pain.

637
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,206
It's just brought me
a new kind of misery.

638
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,688
And I moved further
and further

639
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:00,864
away from the person
I was, until one day

640
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:02,736
I woke up
and I was utterly alone.

641
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:06,914
Each of us came here
because we are afraid.

642
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,873
I'm afraid of getting hurt,

643
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,266
just like you.

644
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,963
And I do everything I can

645
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,227
to escape pain, just like you.

646
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,926
But the cost of escape
is too great.

647
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:23,670
Years ago...

648
00:34:25,324 --> 00:34:26,629
we made a promise
to each other.

649
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:28,849
You jump, I jump.

650
00:34:30,546 --> 00:34:32,331
If you choose to go down
this path...

651
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:36,987
I will be there.

652
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,385
If you want to get
to Supergirl,

653
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,388
you're gonna have to
go through me.

654
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,262
We have to wake up now.

655
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:54,396
We need to end the simulation

656
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,702
once and for all.

657
00:34:58,183 --> 00:34:59,488
I believe in you.

658
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,321
I believe in you.

659
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:07,409
I believe in you.

660
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:15,896
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.

661
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:19,117
It's okay.

662
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:23,904
It's okay.

663
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:25,210
End simulation.

664
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:28,474
End simulation.

665
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:30,650
End simulation.

666
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:33,043
End simulation.

667
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:47,101
Go...

668
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:48,668
on...

669
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,331
I had hoped
you'd die screaming.

670
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,116
But I'll take what I can get.

671
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,782
What have you done?

672
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:22,354
I...

673
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,746
beat...

674
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,618
you.

675
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,190
What's happening?

676
00:36:37,804 --> 00:36:38,761
The Coluan.

677
00:36:47,466 --> 00:36:49,250
I never thought
I'd see the day.

678
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:50,469
Obsidian Platinum,

679
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:52,122
the most popular
VR platform ever created.

680
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,342
And not a single person
is using it.

681
00:36:58,085 --> 00:36:59,521
Alex called...

682
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,828
Leviathan has disappeared.

683
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,090
You did what you
said you would.

684
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:05,048
Almost.

685
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,398
I still have one promise
left to keep.

686
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:11,098
You did it, Querl.

687
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,231
You did it.

688
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:14,493
You saved this world.

689
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,364
You saved your friends.

690
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,413
Will you...

691
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,546
...stay with me?

692
00:37:32,206 --> 00:37:33,686
Till the very end.

693
00:37:38,734 --> 00:37:39,561
Nia.

694
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,697
Who do you think you are?

695
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,353
We had a plan.

696
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:51,051
Leviathan kills Supergirl
and you kill Leviathan.

697
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,922
And together we
save this planet

698
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:54,315
from the invulnerable aliens,

699
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:57,666
who think they know
what's best for mankind.

700
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,321
Why couldn't you just wait

701
00:38:00,365 --> 00:38:02,497
for Supergirl to die?

702
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:06,893
Underestimated me.

703
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:10,070
My friends.

704
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,857
I'd never let you kill them.

705
00:38:19,906 --> 00:38:22,343
No, Braniac 5.

706
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:25,128
Uh, I underestimate nothing.

707
00:38:25,172 --> 00:38:28,349
I knew you would decide to
shrink the gods
instead of kill them

708
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:30,308
due to your precious
moral code.

709
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:31,918
I planned for that.

710
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,921
I just didn't think that
you would kill yourself.

711
00:38:37,097 --> 00:38:38,185
Well...

712
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:39,708
Supergirl lives.

713
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:40,753
But, I have the ball.

714
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:42,711
No...

715
00:38:42,755 --> 00:38:44,409
You gave me exactly...

716
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:46,585
what I needed.

717
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,416
I'm just gonna kill
Supergirl myself.

718
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:53,200
It'll be fun.

719
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:55,724
And you...

720
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:57,944
can die alone.

721
00:38:58,858 --> 00:38:59,815
Just like you intended.

722
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,442
No, no, no, Brainy.

723
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,447
I should have listened to you.

724
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:24,971
It's Brainy.

725
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:27,016
He stopped Leviathan.

726
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:29,454
He saved us.

727
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,327
He needs my help.

728
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:34,763
Oh...

729
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:36,939
Oh, my God.

730
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,552
It's actually you.

731
00:39:47,472 --> 00:39:49,169
In the last world,
she betrayed us.

732
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:53,826
We may never know what
was driving her, but...

733
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,177
I do know what was
driving you.

734
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,224
You didn't want to tell me
who you really were

735
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:02,704
because you didn't want
me to get hurt.

736
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,622
But I did get hurt.

737
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:09,972
And I did what I always do
when people hurt me.

738
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:11,626
I...

739
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,672
built a wall and I suffocated
behind it.

740
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:19,765
Makes it very difficult to
see things from other people's
point of view.

741
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,334
But I see yours now.

742
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,034
And I am very sorry it
took me so long.

743
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:34,649
You know, when you showed
up at my door this morning I...

744
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,042
I didn't wanna let you in.

745
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,654
And I kept waiting for
you to let me down.

746
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:44,354
But at every turn you
came through.

747
00:40:45,878 --> 00:40:46,966
Building that suit.

748
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,970
Protecting my identity,
supporting me.

749
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,410
I wasn't ready to accept
your apology.

750
00:40:58,543 --> 00:41:00,675
But maybe,
maybe I am now.

751
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:08,466
Okay.

752
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:13,209
What now?

753
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,951
Well, there is one bad guy
left to catch.

754
00:41:17,605 --> 00:41:18,911
Let's go take
my brother down.

755
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:36,624
Let's get to work, Doc.

756
00:41:39,758 --> 00:41:40,933
Right away, dear.
