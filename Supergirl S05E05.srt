1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:03,351
Previously onSupergirl...

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,442
It was me.

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:09,400
I erased him from our minds.

4
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:11,837
I as good as murdered
my own brother.

5
00:00:14,492 --> 00:00:16,538
This is not the Phantom Zone.

6
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,192
Don't think of this
as a prison.
I'm not your enemy.

7
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,020
In fact, I think
we can help each other.

8
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:21,847
This is an Aurafacian.

9
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:24,372
This is an alien organism
that attaches to a host body.

10
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,679
All right.
Let's get these down
into holding.

11
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,942
I'm here undercover
to investigate Andrea Rojas.

12
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,988
Two years' worth of reporting

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,512
that suggests
a criminal conspiracy
bigger than Al Capone.

14
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,993
I'd never forgive myself
if you got wrapped up in this.

15
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,082
Leviathan is coming.

16
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,261
Imagine you,
anytime of the day,

17
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,176
anywhere in the world,

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,830
with all your friends.

19
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,050
Then imagine

20
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,704
that all of you can do
anything that comes to mind.

21
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,665
Well, you don't have to
imagine anymore.

22
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:10,287
Obsidian North's
"Collective Dream" VR lenses

23
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:12,072
are now worldwide.

24
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,551
So why are you waiting?

25
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:23,431
Make your imagination
your reality today.

26
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:36,748
Brilliant!

27
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:41,144
Thank you, William.
I'm proud of it.

28
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:43,407
Which is why I want
every department

29
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,061
to be writing about the launch

30
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,150
right up until it happens
on Friday.

31
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,892
Business, entertainment,
sports, politics,

32
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:53,330
work it into your stories
as if our financial well-being

33
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:54,549
depended on it.

34
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:56,116
Because it does.

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,900
-Gross.
-Double gross.

36
00:01:57,943 --> 00:01:59,293
And one more thing.

37
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:02,078
One of you needs to start
giving continual updates

38
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,340
on our growing sales.

39
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,168
We need to pump this up.

40
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,344
-I'm your man.
-Great.

41
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:08,998
Now let's get to it.

42
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,784
It's bad enough
that we have to do
journalism-via-tweet.

43
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,004
Now she wants to
turn us into ad hacks?

44
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:16,397
Speaking of hacks...

45
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:19,704
Joe Pulitzer is certainly
all for it.

46
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:20,966
Uh-huh.

47
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:23,186
I was so sure you were
gonna find something

48
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,797
at that address
listed in his name.

49
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,625
First he is linked
to the death of Dr. Jarrod,

50
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:31,063
then to
whatever "covert action"
happened in Mexico City.

51
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:33,414
I don't know,
I find it hard it to believe
there's no connection.

52
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,459
I know. I guess we were
looking for connections

53
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:37,331
where there weren't any.

54
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:40,247
I mean, he was just
in the wrong place

55
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,900
at the wrong time
with Dr. Jarrod,

56
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:45,774
and then Mexico City
was just about
the Miss Mexico pageant.

57
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,429
William Dey's not a murderer.
He's just a grade-A jerk.

58
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,922
-Kara. Hi.
-Kelly, hey.

59
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,098
-You're just who I needed.
-Is everything okay?

60
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:07,665
Yeah, it's good. I just...

61
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:09,841
I want to get Alex a gift
for our date-aversary,

62
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,539
and I could
really use your help--

63
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:14,237
A Schadel XG-1000
motorcycle helmet,

64
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,891
in small, matte black.

65
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:17,414
Oh. That is very specific.

66
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,938
-So is Alex's Pinterest page.

67
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,636
You know, meeting Alex

68
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,551
is one of the best things
that has happened to me

69
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:26,075
since moving to National City.

70
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,598
But having you
in the picture...

71
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:30,253
-That's been
a pretty cool bonus.

72
00:03:30,297 --> 00:03:33,256
Believe me,
the feeling is mutual.

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,345
But you know what?
I, uh...

74
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,391
I promised all these
reporters upstairs
a round of coffee.

75
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,350
-And if I don't get it,
there will be a riot.
- Okay.

76
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,483
Uh, remember,
small matte black.

77
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:43,832
Got it.

78
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,314
What's the deal?

79
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,403
I've been texting you
all morning.

80
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:51,492
Phones can be hacked.

81
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,233
Call me overly cautious,
but I'm trying to expose

82
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:55,670
one of the world's
most powerful families
as criminals.

83
00:03:55,713 --> 00:03:58,281
That's why I was texting you.

84
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,503
Morning.

85
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,681
I figured out a way I can help.

86
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,335
Kara...

87
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:10,859
Just...

88
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,296
Hear me out. Okay?

89
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,125
From what you've explained,
you have all this evidence

90
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,781
suggesting the Rojases
are masters
of corporate espionage,

91
00:04:20,477 --> 00:04:22,392
and have a team of operatives

92
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,133
and assassins
at their beck and call.

93
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:27,397
But nothing connecting them
directly to the crimes. Right?

94
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,269
Yes, it's a
frustrating failure.

95
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,923
Well, what if I told you

96
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,362
that my sister works
for a small g...

97
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,538
Government agency.

98
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:39,279
And they just arrested someone

99
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,411
who they think
targeted Elena Torres
in Mexico City yesterday.

100
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,152
Kara, don't tell me
you told your sister
about this.

101
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:46,198
I-I didn't tell her details,
but now we have a lead.

102
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:47,461
What's the catch?

103
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,506
Two conditions. One...

104
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,728
You have to sign an NDA
saying you will never tell
anyone where she works.

105
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:55,991
And, two...

106
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:58,428
Kara, I told you
you don't want
any part of this story.

107
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,822
I am not in it for the story.

108
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:01,823
When...

109
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:04,826
When Andrea come to CatCo,

110
00:05:04,869 --> 00:05:07,132
I thought she was
just a bad boss
and a hack journalist.

111
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:11,049
But if she really is
actually involved
in a web of murders,

112
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:13,356
I can't walk away from that.

113
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,358
I am in it for the justice.

114
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,447
You've been going at this solo
for so long.

115
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:18,883
I could be useful.

116
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,321
What's the harm
in letting me help?

117
00:05:21,364 --> 00:05:24,585
The harm is that
you could get hurt.

118
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,370
-I'm not
just talking physically.
-Mmm-hmm.

119
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,459
This has cost me
friends, family.

120
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,375
It's an obsession
that's taken up
two years of my life.

121
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,072
And I don't want that
to happen to you.

122
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:35,987
You don't have to
worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

123
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:36,988
Plus,

124
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,905
if you don't bring me
the offer's off the table.

125
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:46,302
-Okay.

126
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,173
You win. Let's go.

127
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:49,044
Ha!

128
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:54,702
Test subject 0505.
Trial commencement.

129
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,400
Image induce
to human-form 2257.

130
00:05:58,314 --> 00:05:59,402
Now.

131
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,928
Subject induced.

132
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:08,890
Prep for tracking.

133
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:17,246
Q-wave sensors locked and ready
to probe occipital lobe.

134
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,641
Ms. Luthor, you realize
if this goes as planned,

135
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,469
we are about to discover
how to do

136
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:25,950
what it is that doctors,
politicians, even priests
have failed to do.

137
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,257
Rendering people incapable
of hurting each other.

138
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:30,607
Activate.

139
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:43,794
You cannot touch me.

140
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,153
Mr. Dey, if half
your suspicions about
the Rojases are true,

141
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,895
then this presents
a huge security risk.

142
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:01,377
Still, you are here
as observers

143
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,639
so follow my lead.

144
00:07:02,683 --> 00:07:04,380
-Of course.
-Let him in.

145
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,993
Thank you for doing this.

146
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:11,082
Yeah, well, Obsidian Worldwide
is a big deal.

147
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:14,390
Plus, working at Obsidian
is Kelly's dream job,

148
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,566
so before I have the DEO
make any moves on her boss,

149
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,395
I need to be certain
that she is guilty.

150
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,918
Right, yes. Speaking of, uh,

151
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:24,748
Kelly asked me what to get you
for your date-aversary.

152
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,663
She doesn't need to get me--

153
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,623
I told her the Schadel
XG-1000 motorcycle helmet
in small, matte black.

154
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,277
God, I love you.

155
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,541
Is this
some sort of torture device?

156
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,500
It's a Truth Seeker.

157
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:41,199
It makes it so that those
who are inclined to lie, can't.

158
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,419
For example,

159
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,422
did Andrea Rojas hire you
to target Elena Torres?

160
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:49,425
I don't ask who hires me.

161
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,037
My jobs come over
an encrypted server
that compensates me in Bitcoin.

162
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,562
Okay. Have you
ever met Andrea Rojas

163
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,520
or any member
of the Rojas family

164
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:58,826
or anyone that
they are affiliated with?

165
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:02,133
I only meet
the other contractors.

166
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,920
There was this lady
with killer tattoos,

167
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:08,792
a guy who could detach
most of his fingers,

168
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:12,448
and this big dude
with some extra appendages.

169
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,189
-How many--
-How many...

170
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,626
...appendages?

171
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,628
He had four arms.

172
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,413
Like this?

173
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,286
Yeah, that's him.

174
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:25,592
His code name is Rip Roar.

175
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,507
-When did you last see him?
-William.

176
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,900
-Two years ago
on a job in Darien...
-No time after?

177
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:31,162
- No.
-Mr. Dey...

178
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:32,729
So where is he based?
Who are his target?

179
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,514
You have to know something.

180
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,080
I have literally
told you everything.

181
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:37,081
That's a bloody lie!

182
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,648
-That will be enough!
-William.

183
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:39,910
Out!

184
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:43,044
What was that about?

185
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:46,351
-You have to tell me.
-He murdered my best friend.

186
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,266
What?

187
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,792
My mate from college.
Russell Rogers.

188
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,750
Two years ago,
he got suspicious
of the Rojases,

189
00:08:53,794 --> 00:08:57,362
and the next day,
that monster killed him.

190
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,539
-Never found the body.
-Then how do you know
he's dead?

191
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,803
These are professional killers.
They don't leave evidence.

192
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,326
I have a friend
that could help with this.

193
00:09:04,369 --> 00:09:06,110
I should have
never told you any of this.

194
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,460
Now look how involved you are.

195
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,856
It's why I told you
to stay away.

196
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,208
It's an emotional abyss.

197
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:31,048
Hold it. Set the case down.

198
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:33,790
Turn around.

199
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,577
Show me your hands.

200
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,682
Russell Rogers.

201
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,294
I'll look into
his disappearance.

202
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,861
Thank you.

203
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,645
And how are you feeling?

204
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,429
With everything
that happened with Mal...

205
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:07,215
Well,
I'm still processing it all.

206
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:10,697
But it gave me deeper knowledge
about myself and...

207
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,872
And my people.

208
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,787
I can learn from that.

209
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,702
How about you? Are you okay?

210
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,921
You've been through a lot.

211
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:21,142
The reporter you hated
turns out to be a good guy

212
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:23,448
and Andrea Rojas is potentially
involved in murders.

213
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,234
Yeah, I can't talk about this
with anyone but you and Alex.

214
00:10:26,277 --> 00:10:28,453
I swore to William
I'd keep it secret.

215
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,672
Even from Nia.

216
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:33,067
But honestly,
I... I'm, I'm reeling.

217
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,852
I never would have thought
Andrea was a criminal

218
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:39,029
and I was convinced
William was evil.

219
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,901
How could I have been
so wrong about both of them?

220
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,859
And now,
with Obsidian tech everywhere,

221
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,687
I mean, everyone's
just in these

222
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:47,777
make-believe worlds and...

223
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,736
It's hard to know
what's real anymore.

224
00:10:50,824 --> 00:10:52,695
I just want some certainty.

225
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,915
You know, my biggest takeaway

226
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,133
from what happened
with Malefic,

227
00:10:56,177 --> 00:10:59,136
is when the world is uncertain,

228
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,704
there's one thing
that's rock solid.

229
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,880
It's the people
who love you.

230
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,580
Alex needs me at the DEO.

231
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,804
We had a break-in
at Fort Summit.

232
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,893
Please don't tell me
it is Lex's vault.

233
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,766
Indeed.
And this is the assailant.

234
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,681
It is the same guy
William talked about.

235
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:22,899
What did he steal?

236
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:26,076
Mr. Luthor called it
his Marathon Laser.

237
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,731
It's able to launch
a concentrated beam of heat

238
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:31,603
at a target
up to 26.2 miles away.

239
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:32,909
It's an assassin's dream.

240
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,737
Is there any way
we can track it?

241
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,217
We are scanning for the weapon.

242
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,915
With any luck, that will
lead us to the man as well.

243
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,569
William said Rip Roar was

244
00:11:40,612 --> 00:11:43,137
a part of the Rojases's
team of operatives.

245
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,879
Now they're stealing
one of Lex's weapons

246
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,012
the day before the launch
of Andrea's lenses?

247
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,884
If William Dey is right
about Andrea Rojas,

248
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:53,103
there's a high probability
of a connection.

249
00:11:53,147 --> 00:11:55,627
But Kelly did say
the VR launch is virtual.

250
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:57,934
So people aren't gonna be
gathering in one place.

251
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,066
So what use
is that weapon then?

252
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,981
We've gotta be
missing something.

253
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,460
I'll take another run
at Breathtaker.

254
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:03,766
No, we tried that.

255
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:05,725
Even with the Truth Seeker,
she's got nothing.

256
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,292
I might have a solution.

257
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:12,470
There is always
the other assassin we caught.

258
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:13,776
What, O'Connor?

259
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,125
-She's dead.
-Yes.

260
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,867
But her tattoos are alive
and sentient.

261
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:19,695
Wouldn't we need a host?

262
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,305
We would, yes.

263
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:24,700
Approaching me
while I'm still conscious.

264
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,790
How thoughtful of you.

265
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,140
It seems
we have gotten off
on the wrong foot.

266
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,622
So I have a proposition.

267
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,407
You have the ability
to incept thoughts
into people's minds.

268
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:38,845
I want to study your brain,
so I can develop a technology

269
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,542
that can do the same thing.

270
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,762
Forgive my skepticism,

271
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:46,591
but last time
someone showed interest
in my brain,

272
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,550
the High Council sent me
to the Phantom Zone.

273
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,944
You'd be
back in the Phantom Zone
if it wasn't for me.

274
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:54,077
And yet, now we are
at an impasse.

275
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,084
What's in it for me?

276
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:02,869
We both want the same thing.

277
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,655
We were each betrayed
by the people closest to us.

278
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:10,006
Work with me.

279
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,008
I believe you've the ability
to do great things.

280
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,011
I don't want
to do great things.

281
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:17,057
I want revenge.

282
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,842
So I have a proposal for you.

283
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:23,933
Martian biology prevents
a brother from
harming his brother.

284
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,980
That's why I've been
attacking the people
closest to J'onn J'onzz.

285
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:29,896
If you remove
this barrier from my brain

286
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:32,115
so I can kill my brother,

287
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:34,204
I will give you access
to my mind.

288
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,380
It is my mission to stop people
from hurting each other.

289
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:37,468
I will not kill.

290
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,383
Perhaps.

291
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:42,822
But you've gone
to extreme measures
to bring me here.

292
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,825
And now,
you are at the precipice.

293
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,219
Studying my mind is the key.

294
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,441
I know of desperation, human.

295
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:58,098
I know the depths you feel.

296
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,622
I would have to develop
the technology first.

297
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,845
Your terms are acceptable.

298
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,935
Let's begin.

299
00:14:10,284 --> 00:14:11,807
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

300
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,331
Once we say "the phrase,"

301
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,768
you're gonna augment
the executive section
of your brain

302
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:19,510
to allow the Aurafacian
to speak through you.

303
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:21,556
Yes.

304
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,906
And thanks to
my polygraph filter,

305
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,560
it won't be able to lie.

306
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:28,824
That is the phrase.

307
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,695
I've kept it top secret
all day.

308
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:31,696
You're welcome.

309
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,089
Seriously?

310
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,614
It's from the oeuvre
of Mr. Keanu Reeves.

311
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,790
"Pop quiz, hotshot."

312
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,145
Brainy?

313
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:51,978
Release me, human!

314
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:54,023
You know that
we're not going to do that.

315
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,198
We want information.

316
00:14:55,242 --> 00:14:58,158
Come near, I'll give it to you.

317
00:14:58,201 --> 00:15:01,074
You worked with
a contractor named Rip Roar.

318
00:15:01,117 --> 00:15:02,814
He has a very dangerous weapon.

319
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,338
How do we find him?

320
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:08,951
Perhaps put an ad in the paper
for a four-armed freak.

321
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:13,216
There's a chance he might
use this weapon tomorrow.

322
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,871
Do you have any idea
who the target might be?

323
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,526
I never know who's behind it.

324
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,224
All I know

325
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:26,316
is that someone is spending
a great deal of capital...

326
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:31,974
...to do
a great deal of damage.

327
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,497
You've committed
dozens of murders

328
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:36,065
but don't have
the slightest idea
who's responsible?

329
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:37,458
I don't care to know.

330
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,982
You don't care about
all those people you killed?

331
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:42,245
Their family, their friends,

332
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:45,118
all those lives
you've destroyed?

333
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,684
-You have to know something!
-I don't know.

334
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,686
-No, you know something
and we're--
- Hey!

335
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,558
Hey, it's Brainy.

336
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,038
Kryptonia.

337
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,129
Come here! Let me
print myself on your skin!

338
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:57,739
Pop quiz, hotshot!

339
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,745
Uh, did it work?

340
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,097
-Hey.
-I know. I know. I'm sorry.

341
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:10,752
-I overreacted.
-No. You're right.

342
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:12,623
This is getting way bigger
than we thought.

343
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,018
I'm gonna confront Andrea.

344
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,889
Okay, slow down.

345
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,239
We need to be strategic.

346
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,023
Okay? We need to see
the bigger plan here.

347
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,070
Plus, there is still a chance
that she's not even involved.

348
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,593
What makes you say that?

349
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,725
Kelly believes in Andrea,
and the work that she's doing.

350
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,249
It helps people.

351
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:32,252
And Andrea's never even been
accused of anything illegal.

352
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,254
Even according to Will,
Elena Torres offered

353
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,647
only circumstantial evidence
against her.

354
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:38,649
Look, Kelly has been
through the ringer.

355
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:42,044
And I really don't want to
pull the rug out from under her
unless I have to.

356
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,089
Trust me,

357
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:44,177
I want answers too,

358
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,005
but these are big accusations

359
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,310
and we need to be certain.

360
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,138
I know everything you're saying
makes sense,

361
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:50,270
but I have this gut feeling

362
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,707
that Andrea's
up to something big.

363
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,796
Lex Luthor had a plan
for world domination

364
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:55,927
that felt a lot like this.

365
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,234
And that time,
I was almost too late.

366
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,410
I cannot let that happen again.

367
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,238
We won't.

368
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,936
If Andrea's involved,
we'll figure out how.

369
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:07,113
I have an idea.

370
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,376
Supergirl.

371
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,031
I trust your gut, too.

372
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,005
I have the Marathon Laser.

373
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,529
What do you want me
to do with it?

374
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,925
Do what
Lex Luthor failed to do.

375
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,407
Change the world.

376
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,505
Big day tomorrow, William.

377
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,074
Five million subscribers big.

378
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:56,379
And counting.

379
00:17:56,423 --> 00:17:58,207
Now that's the news
I wanna hear.

380
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,218
-Careful now.

381
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,612
That's my brain
you're about to play with.

382
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:14,005
The occipital lobe is where
the Q-waves are generated.

383
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,140
Q-waves are projected
like sonar from a dolphin.

384
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,621
But your waves
are a very special frequency

385
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,449
that allows you
this unique ability

386
00:18:22,492 --> 00:18:25,147
to control the thoughts
and emotions of others.

387
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,149
This is the frequency
we want to isolate.

388
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:30,500
That "unique ability"

389
00:18:30,544 --> 00:18:32,981
has been my cross to bear
my whole life.

390
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:35,157
To think

391
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:38,204
it comes down to something
as simple as a frequency...

392
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:40,815
All you have to do
is incept
these three test subjects.

393
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,252
All right?
There's a Daxamite Scorpion,

394
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,297
a Terran Oceanic Devil,

395
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,081
and a Maladorian Dendroasp.

396
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,910
As you project
your waves at them,

397
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:50,390
we'll measure the frequency,

398
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,348
fine-tuning as we go,
'til we hit the magic number.

399
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,655
So, are we ready?

400
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:58,049
As long as killing J'onn J'onzz
is the final result,

401
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,617
"we" can't wait.

402
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,054
I really appreciate
you bringing food.

403
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:04,839
It's exactly what I needed.

404
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:07,363
It's gonna be
another very late night, so...

405
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,756
Oh, no. What happened?

406
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,325
Oh. You know,
just another day at the DEO.

407
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:14,153
A stolen Luthor weapon

408
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,286
and a conspiracy
of meta-assassins.

409
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,333
Well, I am here for you

410
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,335
if you ever need to
talk about anything.

411
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,379
Of course.

412
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,641
How are you?

413
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:26,426
Well,

414
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:30,299
Obsidian is abuzz
with the launch,

415
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,954
and I had my first
patient success story.

416
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:35,391
Yeah. He was having nightmares
for over a year.

417
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,264
And with VR therapy,
they stopped.

418
00:19:38,307 --> 00:19:40,657
That's amazing.

419
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:42,137
Oh. And...

420
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,618
I made a surprise reservation
for our date-aversary.

421
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:46,924
-At the waterfront.
-Really?

422
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,099
-That's nice.

423
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:49,840
But don't you
have to be on deck

424
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,538
for the Obsidian launch?

425
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:53,583
Well, since it's virtual,
I can bring
the lenses to dinner,

426
00:19:53,627 --> 00:19:56,412
and then we can join millions
in virtual celebration.

427
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:58,371
Okay, now that sounds like

428
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,503
one of your boss's
freaky advertisements.

429
00:20:00,547 --> 00:20:04,246
Just because it's freaky,
doesn't mean it's not awesome.

430
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,117
-Well, cheers to that.
-Ah.

431
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,338
Okay.

432
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:15,518
-William.

433
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,651
I'm looking for clues
to what Andrea's been up to.

434
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:20,436
Well, I am, too.
But if Andrea sees you in here,
she'll kill you.

435
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,438
-And that's not a metaphor.
-It's fine.

436
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,092
I... I looped the cameras.

437
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,268
I borrowed something
from the DEO.
What are you doing here?

438
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:27,661
What I should've done
in the first place,

439
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,402
gone straight to the source.

440
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:32,100
Now, thanks to my friends
at MI-8, I can.

441
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:33,275
But, well,
you should know first

442
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,190
the DEO got a lead
on Rip Roar.

443
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,454
Where? How?

444
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,326
From what I understand,

445
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,458
he's stolen
a pretty powerful weapon.

446
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:44,330
And they're afraid
he's gonna use it

447
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,593
in connection
with Andrea's launch.

448
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,290
That means we have
less than a day

449
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,944
to figure out
what she's planning.

450
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,468
- You really think

451
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,557
Andrea would leave
information on her laptop?

452
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,906
I mean,
she's kind of tech savant.

453
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,386
Oh, there's got to be
something in here.

454
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,302
If there is,
don't you think it'd be like,

455
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,435
in a nook or cranny

456
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:04,567
or under the floor
or something.

457
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,700
You look your way,
I'll look mine.

458
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,271
-Of course
she has a Firewall.

459
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,581
"Access denied?"

460
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:24,370
I think I hit pay dirt.

461
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,895
How did you know
to look in there?

462
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,026
Lucky guess.

463
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,681
But look what
she has stashed in here.

464
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,684
Foreign currency,
I mean, that's pretty shady.

465
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,426
Uh, some sort of chain and...

466
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,212
Hello.

467
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:42,475
Isn't that Russell?

468
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:43,737
Did they know each other?

469
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:48,698
They more than just
"knew each other."

470
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,613
At least according to Russell

471
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,093
the last time I saw him.

472
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,316
-Wow.
-I'm crazy about her.
I think she's the one.

473
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:00,319
Man, you are sunk.

474
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,103
Well, almost.

475
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,584
-What do you mean?
-She comes from
a powerful family.

476
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,803
You know, there's a lot
going on there.

477
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,805
And they make a point
about shutting me out.

478
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:10,546
-What? They don't think
you are good enough?
-Nah.

479
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,852
It's not that.

480
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:16,247
It's more like
they got secrets.

481
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,640
What, like dead bodies?

482
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,992
Oi, you're not getting
into something dodgy, are you?

483
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,342
Nothing I can't handle.

484
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:24,995
This doesn't sound good, Russ.

485
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,389
I just don't know
how deep these things go
with these people.

486
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:29,609
But Andrea
is nothing like her family.

487
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,393
I'll sort it out
with her tonight.

488
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,221
Then tomorrow,

489
00:22:33,264 --> 00:22:36,224
I can figure out a time
when she can finally meet
my best friend.

490
00:22:36,267 --> 00:22:38,008
What, you haven't mentioned me?

491
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,662
If you think I'd let her
anywhere near
that wicked smile of yours

492
00:22:39,706 --> 00:22:42,099
before we're settled,
you're madder than I thought.

493
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,666
-Ah.

494
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,625
That was the last
I saw of him.

495
00:22:47,148 --> 00:22:48,628
Russell?

496
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:50,281
You need a new lock, mate.

497
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,424
Stop!

498
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,208
-Where's Russell?
-Dead.

499
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,484
Oh, my God, William.
That's horrible.

500
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:20,964
Let's get out of here.

501
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,930
Well,
I reset the cameras.

502
00:23:29,973 --> 00:23:32,628
No one will know
we were in Andrea's office.

503
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,413
She has to be involved in this.

504
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,066
Rip Roar, Russell.

505
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,547
Do you remember
how she reacted
when it happened?

506
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:39,853
She is a billionaire heiress.

507
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:41,637
I didn't have access to her.

508
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,552
The police
couldn't find anything,

509
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,598
so they just presumed
he skipped town.

510
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,861
-There's no body, no leads.

511
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:49,166
So I tried to find some leads

512
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,517
by researching Andrea
and her family.

513
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,649
I know I'm on
the right track here,

514
00:23:53,693 --> 00:23:55,477
just haven't
been able to prove it.

515
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,697
And now,
with Russ's killer back,

516
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,003
maybe it's time
I just ask her point blank.

517
00:24:00,047 --> 00:24:01,657
William, don't even
joke about that.

518
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,920
We... We have to be certain
of what we're up against first.

519
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:06,053
Now is not the time
to be rash.

520
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,358
Look who's talking.

521
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:09,665
You broke into Andrea's office
before I did.

522
00:24:09,709 --> 00:24:12,929
That's true.
But you've...

523
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:16,019
You've dedicated
so much of your life
to this already.

524
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:19,240
What's the risk in hanging on
just for a little bit longer?

525
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,633
Is that what you told yourself

526
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,895
when you were chasing
the Lex Luthor story?

527
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:24,593
To slow down
and "hang on?"

528
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:26,073
Actually, yeah, it was.

529
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,163
And it was really hard.

530
00:24:29,206 --> 00:24:32,645
But I did it because
I could feel that I was close.

531
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,604
Just like I can feel
we are so close right now.

532
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:39,913
That's, uh...
Sorry, it's my sister.

533
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,481
Alex, what's up?

534
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,700
Brainy tracked the signature
of the Marathon Laser

535
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:46,876
to the Socorro
Satellite Station
in New Mexico.

536
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,530
We need Supergirl there now.

537
00:24:48,574 --> 00:24:50,227
I'm on my way.

538
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,449
Something came up
with my family.

539
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:57,583
But just promise me
you're not gonna do anything.

540
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,424
Rip Roar.

541
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,993
I know who you are.

542
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:19,213
And I know
you killed Russell Rogers.

543
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:20,649
You know nothing.

544
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:22,172
And you're out of your depth.

545
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:36,012
Alex.

546
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,885
I need J'onn.

547
00:25:48,808 --> 00:25:50,200
Thank you
for helping me.

548
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:51,158
I'm feeling a lot better.

549
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,594
You know
I'm always here for you.

550
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:54,204
Hey, look, I tracked down

551
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,467
the apartment where
Russell Rogers lived in London.

552
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,731
I did a psychic sweep.

553
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,472
I did see evidence of a struggle there years ago,

554
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:02,691
but nothing else.

555
00:26:02,735 --> 00:26:03,910
You mean he's still alive?

556
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:06,042
Possibly. I'm still looking.

557
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:11,961
Where are we on Rip Roar
and what did he hit me with?

558
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,833
It's called
a Fusion Cannon.

559
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,835
Or at least it is
100 years from now.

560
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:18,881
It's the result
of the ingenious combination
of Lex's Marathon Laser

561
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,883
plus a particle amplifier.

562
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:25,845
That's what Rip Roar stole
from the satellite base.

563
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:28,456
Yes, the combined technologies
create an energy beam

564
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:31,067
100 times hotter
than the center of the sun.

565
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,852
If it's capable
of damage like that,

566
00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,462
imagine what else it can do.

567
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:35,463
We need to find it.

568
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:37,291
Uh, yes, about that...

569
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:40,120
The amplifier's radiation
obfuscates the cannon's
energy signature,

570
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,731
which makes tracking it
quite difficult.

571
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,951
Well, Obsidian North's launch
is today.

572
00:26:44,994 --> 00:26:46,648
So whatever
Andrea's been up to,

573
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,694
will probably come to a head.

574
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:51,218
Brainy, is there anything
about the launch
we might have missed?

575
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:53,133
Negative.

576
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:56,223
Gotta be connected.

577
00:26:56,963 --> 00:27:02,011
Andrea, Rip Roar, the weapon.

578
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:05,493
And we've got to find out how
before he hurts anyone else.

579
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,712
He's got to be stopped.

580
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,853
Alex, hi, it's me.

581
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,463
Look, I know you're busy,

582
00:27:19,507 --> 00:27:21,291
so I will text you the address
for the restaurant tonight.

583
00:27:21,335 --> 00:27:23,903
And if you're running late,
don't worry.

584
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:25,600
Just get there when you can.

585
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,254
And we'll start to relax.

586
00:27:28,342 --> 00:27:29,778
Okay, people.

587
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,693
The Collective Dream launch
is in less than an hour.

588
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:33,564
William, what is
our user count?

589
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,354
We'll have nine million.

590
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:42,182
That's more than
the population of most
of the world's countries.

591
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:43,357
Well done.

592
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:47,753
And now,
our final test subject,

593
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,668
the Maladorian Dendroasp.

594
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:51,974
It is 100 times
more aggressive than
anything on Earth.

595
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:54,760
I want you to do to it
what you did to them.

596
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:56,718
Sensors are ready
and calibrated.

597
00:27:57,937 --> 00:27:58,807
Now.

598
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:28,968
Satisfied?

599
00:28:30,186 --> 00:28:31,448
It worked.

600
00:28:33,363 --> 00:28:35,583
Lake Vostok.

601
00:28:35,626 --> 00:28:36,932
Okay, in English, Brainy.

602
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:38,934
Actually, it's in Antarctica,

603
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:40,631
where I believe
Rip Roar is heading.

604
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:41,850
Antarctica?

605
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,765
After cross-referencing

606
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:45,636
information gleaned
from Breathtaker

607
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,203
and the Aurafacian,

608
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,466
I have discovered
that each of
the three Rojas assassins

609
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,077
all targeted an employee

610
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,688
of the Lake Vostok
Antarctica Base,

611
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,037
all within the last month.

612
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:57,779
A scientist, an engineer
and a security officer?

613
00:28:57,823 --> 00:28:59,302
What's the significance?

614
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,565
Well, given what
each of the targeted
individuals knew,

615
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,830
it is possible that
every single security protocol
on that base

616
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:05,787
can now be overridden.

617
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:07,310
I still don't get it.

618
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:10,139
Lake Vostok is the largest
subglacial lake in the world.

619
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:13,403
Now, I'm no super-villain,

620
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,101
but if I were,

621
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,320
and I was right over
an Antarctic lake

622
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:21,803
with a weapon designed
to fire a beam 100 times hotter
than the center of the sun,

623
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,936
well, it would be, as they say,

624
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,155
"a hot time in
the old town tonight."

625
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,507
Not that that's a good thing.

626
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:32,901
So you're saying that
he's going to melt the ice cap

627
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:34,511
around Lake Vostok?

628
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,209
If he did that,

629
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:39,821
it would unleash a flood
unseen since the time
of Noah's Ark.

630
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,100
This one's still alive.

631
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,849
Rip Roar, no!

632
00:30:19,339 --> 00:30:20,644
Status?

633
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,081
A massive eruption
in the Antarctic water table

634
00:30:22,124 --> 00:30:23,560
has sent shock waves
east and west,

635
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:26,172
resulting in an unprecedented
number of sea swells.

636
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:27,913
Based on the seafloor pattern

637
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:30,045
and the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current,

638
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:31,177
the biggest is set
to make landfall

639
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,005
on the Pacific coast
in under an hour.

640
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:34,267
Which part
of the Pacific coast?

641
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,183
All of it.

642
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,018
Leaving so soon?

643
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,634
Smart move.

644
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,595
What have you done?

645
00:30:58,639 --> 00:30:59,945
I do what they tell me to.

646
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,816
They? Who is "they?"

647
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,991
I don't know.

648
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:05,907
Supergirl,
can you hear me?

649
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,343
Alex, we have Rip Roar,

650
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:09,084
but he punched a hole
in the lake.

651
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:11,913
We know. The eruption
just sent a tidal wave our way.

652
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:13,088
We can deal
with the swell, Supergirl.

653
00:31:13,132 --> 00:31:15,308
You and J'onn
need to seal that geyser,

654
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:18,050
or else we'll have
bigger problems than a wave.

655
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:19,921
What do you mean?

656
00:31:19,965 --> 00:31:23,098
That geyser is pumping out
three cubic miles of water
every second.

657
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:25,187
At that rate,
every coastal city in the world

658
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,189
will start flooding
in 12 minutes.

659
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:29,235
The loss of life
could be in the billions.

660
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:33,979
So how do we stop that wave?

661
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:35,850
Dreamer.

662
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,982
It's too late.

663
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,375
Once it's started
it can't be stopped.

664
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:40,376
Trust me,

665
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:42,378
I can stop this.

666
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,120
Thank you.

667
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,093
Welcome one and all
to the most amazing party

668
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,833
you'll ever attend.

669
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:04,270
Welcome,

670
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:07,012
welcome to The Communal Dream.

671
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,845
Welcome,

672
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,021
welcome, everyone.

673
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,071
We'll have to
invert the flow of water.

674
00:32:23,115 --> 00:32:24,333
The geyser's pushing it up.

675
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,683
Maybe a whirlpool
could pull it down.

676
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:28,381
We'll fly around the base.

677
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:31,166
But we need to do it
in perfect formation.

678
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,646
With this amount of water,

679
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:35,257
the suction could
pull you under
and suffocate you.

680
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,216
Well then, we'd better
keep our cool.

681
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:45,180
Why aren't you at the launch?

682
00:32:45,224 --> 00:32:47,052
Did you find something
more important?

683
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:49,271
Actually...

684
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:51,839
I did find something.

685
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:54,711
His name is Russell Rogers.

686
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,278
What?

687
00:32:57,323 --> 00:32:59,107
I saw the photo, Andrea.

688
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,067
I know all about
the two of you.

689
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:06,071
What did you do with him?

690
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:07,898
I don't know
what you're talking about.

691
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,248
I know about O'Connor

692
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:11,946
and Breathtaker and Rip Roar.

693
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,469
I know about you
and your family,

694
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:16,255
and everything
you've gotten away with.

695
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:19,649
Corruption, theft, murder.

696
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:22,217
But you're not going to
get away with it any longer.

697
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:25,046
Because I am
going to destroy you,

698
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:27,440
if it's the last thing I do.

699
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,571
William...

700
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:31,618
William?

701
00:33:35,274 --> 00:33:36,884
The launch is going great,
don't you think?

702
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,408
Sure is, Ms. Rojas.

703
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:49,027
Dreamer?

704
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:56,773
That's a huge wave!

705
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,694
Brainy, I hope this works.

706
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,148
Everybody get to high ground!

707
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,062
Go!

708
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:29,067
Right. I got you. Down!

709
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:51,045
Go! Everybody move, move!

710
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,154
Hmm.

711
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:17,245
Now!

712
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,653
Did he say anything?

713
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,177
He isn't talking.
Even with the Truth Seeker.

714
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,310
But he said "they."

715
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:40,050
"They" told him
to do what he did.

716
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,443
He has to know something.

717
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,229
But according to Brainy,
I mean, the tech he wears

718
00:35:44,272 --> 00:35:45,926
is biologically adhered

719
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:48,798
and it functions as
some sort of mental armor.

720
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,191
We can't get to him.

721
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:53,020
Also, it wasn't the Rojases.

722
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:55,631
-What?
-We ran the analytics.

723
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,285
Okay, flooding the West Coast

724
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:00,027
would've taken out
Obsidian North's
manufacturing hub.

725
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,072
And if you and J'onn
hadn't stopped the geyser,

726
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,944
then they would've
lost billions.

727
00:36:03,987 --> 00:36:06,338
I gotta say, I'm glad that
I don't have to tell Kelly

728
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,383
that her boss is a crime lord.

729
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:12,170
But this still leaves us
with a case
that doesn't make any sense.

730
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,433
If it wasn't Andrea
and the Rojases,

731
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:16,217
who was calling the shots?

732
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,871
Someone has to be behind this.

733
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,089
I agree.

734
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,743
And whoever it is,
we're gonna find them.

735
00:36:20,787 --> 00:36:23,224
It just might take longer
than we thought.

736
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,098
There's something
you both should see.

737
00:36:49,337 --> 00:36:52,427
-Kelly, you okay?

738
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:53,863
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

739
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:54,951
Yeah.

740
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,692
Yeah.

741
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:00,000
Yesterday was just, um,

742
00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:01,915
a lot.

743
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,830
With everything that happened
at the waterfront.

744
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:07,399
And Alex was...
She was amazing.

745
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,315
But I was there

746
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:14,014
and I almost saw her die.

747
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,408
I guess it triggered me.

748
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:17,757
I'm so sorry.

749
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,239
Look, I know that Alex
can take care of herself.

750
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,284
I do. But...

751
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,986
My fiancé died
fighting on the front lines,

752
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,859
and I never got over it.

753
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,819
This brought it all back.

754
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:42,347
I just... I can't shake
this feeling of...

755
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:47,526
...dread.

756
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:50,006
Well, it sounds to me
like you could use a friend.

757
00:37:51,965 --> 00:37:54,533
Do you wanna
grab lunch sometime and talk?

758
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:57,013
I'd like that.

759
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,538
Thank you.

760
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,545
It is finished.

761
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:11,027
What is?

762
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:13,378
I have clarity on how
to dispose of my brother,

763
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:16,990
now that you've removed
my mental block.

764
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:18,252
But I didn't remove it.

765
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,342
I could never let you
hurt another person.

766
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:23,562
We had a deal.

767
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:25,694
If you intuited anything
about my research,
you'd know that.

768
00:38:31,613 --> 00:38:33,441
You like it here, don't you?

769
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:34,529
Yes.

770
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:37,184
I like it here.

771
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,969
I like it very much.

772
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,812
You look beautiful.

773
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:59,598
Well, I did wear
your favorite color.

774
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:01,991
Um...

775
00:39:02,035 --> 00:39:04,429
I'm so sorry that I missed
our date-aversary

776
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:05,908
and your voicemail.

777
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:08,520
But you know what
we're up against.

778
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:12,350
You were incredibly brave.

779
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,091
-Well, I've developed
a few skills over the years.

780
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,702
Um...

781
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:19,487
Hey. Uh, come here.
I... I got you something.

782
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,533
Oh, I got you something, too,

783
00:39:21,576 --> 00:39:23,012
but I forgot to bring it.

784
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:25,014
Oh, that's okay. This isn't
our real date-aversary.

785
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:27,974
So when it is,
you can give it to me then.

786
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:30,324
Close your eyes.

787
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,370
-Close them.
-Okay.

788
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,332
Okay, open.

789
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:42,989
A Schadel XG-1000.

790
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:45,426
So you can be
my riding partner.

791
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,997
This is amazing.

792
00:39:52,781 --> 00:39:55,218
I'm just so glad that
we can be together right now.

793
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:58,787
Thank you.

794
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,147
Don't worry.

795
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:13,323
I didn't confront Andrea.

796
00:40:13,367 --> 00:40:14,673
Though, believe me,
I wanted to.

797
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:18,459
Now, I'm even more
confused than ever.

798
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,505
The Rojases
would've lost everything

799
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,810
if Rip Roar had succeeded.

800
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:25,684
If they're not the villains,
then who?

801
00:40:25,727 --> 00:40:28,208
And now it gets
even more confusing.

802
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:29,383
Um...

803
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:32,647
The DEO caught Rip Roar

804
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:35,215
and they were able to ID him.

805
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:37,565
It's Russell.

806
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,525
No. What?

807
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,396
That's... That's not possible.

808
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,662
I thought they killed him.

809
00:40:47,706 --> 00:40:50,665
All of this
was to avenge his death.

810
00:40:50,709 --> 00:40:52,058
I don't believe it.

811
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,452
What could they have done
to turn him into that...

812
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:56,584
monster?

813
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,456
I'm so sorry.

814
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,503
I know how painful this is.

815
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:05,506
But now that
we have him in custody,

816
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:06,638
the good thing is

817
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,770
we can finally
get you some answers.

818
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:10,598
About him, about Andrea,

819
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,600
about any other questions
we might uncover.

820
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,126
Thank you.

821
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,782
You know I didn't want you
involved in this.

822
00:41:20,826 --> 00:41:23,176
But I don't know how I would've
done it without you.

823
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:28,747
Thank you.

824
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:35,057
You've really outdone yourself
with those contact lenses.

825
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:38,191
I hear they're as omnipresent
as one of our plagues

826
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:39,453
or floods.

827
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,802
That was you yesterday?

828
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:42,804
Leviathan is everywhere.

829
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,719
And now a problem has come up.

830
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,416
We need you to fix it.

831
00:41:46,678 --> 00:41:48,201
It's Rip Roar.
