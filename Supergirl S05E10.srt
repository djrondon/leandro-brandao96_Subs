1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:03,612
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:03,655 --> 00:00:06,528
Dark Kryptonian witches want to resurrect Reign and use her to terraform the Earth,

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,225
turning it into a new Krypton.

4
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,227
Leviathan is coming.

5
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,533
You can go, Margot.

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:16,320
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined.

7
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:19,976
The DEO, CatCo,
all of National City is
on this Earth now.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,022
Lex Luthor has
the Book of Destiny.

9
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:25,547
We thought destiny could use
a little rewrite.

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,202
- People think
Lex is a good guy?
-He's the boss!

11
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:29,681
He owns this place.

12
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:34,512
We live in a world
on the cutting edge.

13
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,514
And as mankind advances,

14
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:39,082
so too does the danger
it faces.

15
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:41,432
For years, we protected
America in secret.

16
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:44,870
But now, we want you to know
you're in good hands.

17
00:00:50,398 --> 00:00:53,053
Hope, help
and compassion for all.

18
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,185
-That's our motto here at...
-The DEO.

19
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:57,274
Call us for all
your extranormal needs.

20
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:02,975
Duh! Gag me with a spoon.
I don't care what
world we're on,

21
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:06,457
I can't ever see a version
of myself agreeing to do
that commercial.

22
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,765
Well, on this planet,
you and Lex were
excellent collaborators.

23
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,724
No, stop! This is literally
my nightmare.

24
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,204
Okay, well,
how do you think I feel?

25
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,206
I've been totally in the dark.

26
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,947
Thank God J'onn gave me
my memories back.

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,818
Yeah, I know, I wish he could
do it for everyone.

28
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:24,388
Well, according to him,
restoring the world's
collective memories

29
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:27,435
would reconfigure relationships
on such a massive scale

30
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,220
that everyone's minds
would literally be blown.

31
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,613
Ugh, gross.

32
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:35,051
Well, the DEO is
a hellmouth now,
so there's that.

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,140
-Has CatCo changed?
-Still a tabloid.

34
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:40,012
But everyone's on
the Lex Luthor train,
which is great.

35
00:01:40,056 --> 00:01:41,579
Including Andrea.

36
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,712
He's getting some
Man of Tomorrow award,

37
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,453
and she sent me
and William to cover it.

38
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:48,760
I... uh, I can't believe
even William is drinking
the Lex Kool-Aid.

39
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:51,241
Well, you gotta give him
a little break, okay.

40
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:54,114
The only people that know
the truth are the ones whose
memories have been restored.

41
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,681
So it's Brainy, Nia, Kelly...

42
00:01:56,725 --> 00:01:58,335
All the heroes
who helped at the Crisis,

43
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,643
including you know who,
which just makes my blood boil.

44
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:04,254
Well, the Luthors are a breed
of their own.

45
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:06,343
Yeah, speaking of which,

46
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,477
I have to talk to Lena.

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,567
Look, on this Earth,
Lena and Supergirl
are partners.

48
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,613
And as far as I'm concerned,
she's not trying to
mind control the planet.

49
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:19,313
Plus, she doesn't hate you,
so maybe Lena not having
her memories

50
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,444
is a good thing.

51
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,185
No, no.

52
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,841
As much  as I would
love to have a clean slate
with Lena,

53
00:02:26,972 --> 00:02:29,192
I owe it to her
to tell the truth.

54
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:31,455
I made that mistake once,
I'm not going to do it again.

55
00:02:31,499 --> 00:02:33,196
- Hey, there, sleepy head.

56
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,417
I fried a couple of eggs
for you.

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,984
Methohexital hangovers
are no joke.

58
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,029
You must be ravenous.

59
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,075
This can't be real.

60
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:45,730
You're dead.

61
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,733
So, you remember everything?

62
00:02:48,777 --> 00:02:50,822
Of course I remember!
I killed you!

63
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,173
Yes, that's right,
you killed me.

64
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:56,176
But that is all in the past.

65
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,569
-Because I'm back now,

66
00:02:58,613 --> 00:03:00,136
and I forgive you.

67
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,660
What are you talking about?
What is happening?

68
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:05,750
Well, it was, uh...
sort of a Crisis.

69
00:03:06,882 --> 00:03:10,015
It was an...
antimatter wave.

70
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,800
-Ah, yes.
-Alex and I worked together.

71
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:13,932
-Mmm-hmm.
-We built a portal...

72
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:15,543
The wave still came?

73
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:18,110
Yes, and billions were lost
and the multi-verse collapsed,

74
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:19,503
and it was all
very interesting.

75
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:24,029
What matters now
is that a very powerful person

76
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,336
brought me back
to life to help.

77
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,033
But I refused to do so,
unless he promised

78
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:31,689
that you would
make it through okay,
and you have,

79
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:33,735
with your noggin intact.

80
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,868
You gambled the fate
of the entire multi-verse
to get your own way?

81
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,348
It gets better.
In this new world,

82
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:42,396
we work side by side
at Luthor Corp and the DEO

83
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,049
to make the world
a better place.

84
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,181
So I'm in hell.

85
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,749
No, no,
you're in a new reality.

86
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:51,274
To the outside world,
we're billionaire
philanthropists.

87
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:52,797
It's the perfect cover.

88
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,973
-I want nothing to do with you.
-Ah, yes, you want to

89
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:57,628
fix humanity
with your project Non Nocere.

90
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:01,676
And using Myriad to broadcast
the Q-waves. That was smart.

91
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,201
But you should have known
the moment you decided to steal
from a Kryptonian,

92
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,638
the Non Nocere was doomed.

93
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,554
Kara Danvers will never see
things your way.

94
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:13,296
She'll always work against you.

95
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,037
Right, so you'll be
my friend now?

96
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,082
The world is ours now, Lena.

97
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,350
You don't need a robot
and you don't need friends.

98
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:24,655
You need a partner.

99
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:27,963
Imagine what
we could accomplish together.

100
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,575
Why not give it a go?

101
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,403
So you think
this is your world now?

102
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:39,322
You were a puppet on a string
for Leviathan before.

103
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:41,150
What makes this time
any different?

104
00:04:43,152 --> 00:04:44,675
What the hell is Leviathan?

105
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:55,947
I want you to know
I'll be doubling my efforts
to calibrate my emotions

106
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,906
with my actions.

107
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,040
To wit, your favorite
breakfast smoothie.

108
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:05,479
And despite every urge
in my corporeal being,

109
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:07,872
I ordered only two.

110
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,483
Thanks, Brainy.

111
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:13,269
My good man,
I'm picking up a to-go order
for Barney Fife,

112
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,314
-if anyone asks...
-Halt.

113
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:18,405
Oh, my.

114
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:20,755
What?
What is the meaning of this?

115
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,018
-Meaning... I don't--
-Who are you?

116
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,411
-I'm Brainiac-5.
-What?

117
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,674
-Liar!
-You, sir,

118
00:05:26,717 --> 00:05:29,720
are the larcenist
and pretender. How did
you accomplish this ruse?

119
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:31,809
Could it be an image inducer?

120
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,638
-The question of pretending
is to you, sir!

121
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:37,772
What are you, huh?
Martian, Durlan?

122
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:39,339
Is your face made of clay?

123
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,297
Unhand me, you charlatan!

124
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,647
Okay, that's it. I'm taking you
into the DEO for questioning.

125
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:44,953
Okay, that's rich!
Guess what,

126
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,346
I'm taking you into the DEO
for questioning.

127
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,521
Oh, that's rich...

128
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,352
Citizens arrest!

129
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,451
I've been looking for you.

130
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,671
Here I am.

131
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:11,632
So, uh, there's something
I have to tell you.

132
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:13,634
I know you think
Lex is a good man,

133
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:17,159
-that he's your partner--
-Save it. I already know.

134
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:19,379
What exactly do you know?

135
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,859
The Crisis, what Lex did.

136
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:24,209
-What you did.
-Lex.

137
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,776
That you took the punch.

138
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,691
What did you think would
happen when you came here?

139
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,606
That you'd tell me everything
in a fit of selflessness,

140
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,653
even if it meant that I knew
how you betrayed me,

141
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:35,046
and then I'd just keel over
and forgive you.

142
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,657
Lena, I hurt you. I--

143
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:38,876
I know I hurt you.

144
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,401
And I'm never ever going
to do it again.

145
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:44,055
And I know how much good
you want to do in the world.

146
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,841
Just think of what we could do
together to help people.

147
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:48,625
Funny.

148
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,541
Lex gave me the same pitch.

149
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,064
He asked you to help him?

150
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,374
You're not seriously
considering it, are you?

151
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:02,378
Please, just be careful.

152
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,735
Director Danvers!

153
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,130
What is going on?

154
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:16,261
Exactly the correct question.

155
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:17,480
Paradox to be sure.

156
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,351
There must be a reasonable
explanation.

157
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:21,266
And we will get one,
once you confess.

158
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,226
Uh, I know I'm gonna regret
asking this question,

159
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:26,924
but which of you
is my Brainy?

160
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,448
How can you
seriously ask that?

161
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,492
Well...

162
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,146
Get an interrogation
room ready.

163
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,540
I'm sorry,
who the hell are you?

164
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,064
I'm Director Brainiac-5
of the DEO.

165
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,196
I am the Director of the DEO.

166
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,591
Why is everyone yelling!

167
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,767
Oh, you have got
to be sprocking me!

168
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:48,032
You're all in grave danger.

169
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,167
Don't let him open...

170
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:54,169
the bottle.

171
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,747
Someone killed him?

172
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,053
He was targeted,
which means any of the
others could be next.

173
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,361
No,
you weren't kidding.

174
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:13,754
No. Thank you.

175
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:19,237
DNA doesn't lie,
so you are all Brainiac-5.

176
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:24,504
This reminds me of a situation
with some crabs on Helven.

177
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,331
Terrible experience.

178
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,900
He seems to have been killed
by some sort
of biosynthetic virus.

179
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,250
The Anti-Life Equation.

180
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,338
The... sorry, what?

181
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,471
It's a techno-organic poison.

182
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,255
It's targeted and transmitted
through the big brain.

183
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,040
It's really scary, man!

184
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,563
I've never heard
of such a thing.

185
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,260
We're supposed to believe
that you're the Brainy Prime?

186
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,611
Well, it's true. He's ours.

187
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:49,224
Well, then this can't be
our world.

188
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,791
Which means we must have
stumbled through
some sort of...

189
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,488
Dimensional wormhole.

190
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,359
From our different universes.

191
00:08:54,403 --> 00:08:56,536
Wormhole... Universes, yeah.

192
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,929
I'm sorry, guys,
there's a slight crisis--

193
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:02,019
The only logical path forward
is to find the nexus point
of our arrival,

194
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,544
if we're ever
to ascertain how it is
we came to be here,

195
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:06,981
why our deceased
comrade warned us
we're in grave danger?

196
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,592
What that bottle was
he urged us not to open?

197
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,247
After which, we can
all safely return
to our respective Earths.

198
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:14,249
Agreed.

199
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,207
Yes, except you can't return
to your Earths because
the multi-verse is dead.

200
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:17,382
-So.
- Brainy.

201
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:22,605
Oh, uh, all right.
That is insensitive.

202
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,347
What? The multi-verse,
it's dead?

203
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,045
Unless there's a vibrational
frequency henceforth

204
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:30,570
unknown to man, then...

205
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,659
our universe is
the only one that's left.

206
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,965
- Apologies
for the interruption,

207
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,402
but would Director Danvers
and Supergirl, please report

208
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:38,752
to the conference room
immediately?

209
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,582
What do you want, Lex?

210
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,591
-Peace.
-It's never gonna happen.

211
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,244
Look,  I get it,

212
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:56,987
feels icky, but why don't
we think about it
in another way?

213
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:01,078
Why go to war
and make things messy,

214
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:03,820
when we could all play
a comfortable game
of chess?

215
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,214
You could keep an eye on me,
I could keep an eye on you,

216
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,869
and in the meantime,
the world would have
its favorite heroes

217
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:12,089
standing shoulder to shoulder
to keep threats like
the Anti-Monitor

218
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:15,571
and Leviathan at bay.

219
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,574
Say, what's happening
with those guys anyway?
Any rumblings?

220
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,707
The Anti-Monitor is gone.

221
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,840
And we haven't found a trace
of Leviathan since the
multi-verse collapsed. So...

222
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,495
So the only threat
to this world is you.

223
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:27,627
I'm sorry to hear that.

224
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,371
Look, take a day
to think it over.

225
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,722
And if you choose peace,

226
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:39,639
I'll expect you by my side,
publicly, at the Man
of Tomorrow ceremony.

227
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,467
But if you don't,

228
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:45,166
I suppose we'll have
a little more apocalypse.

229
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,778
Eighty-two percent
of customers with cell phone
plans have purchased

230
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:51,302
our VR add-on.
But we can still do better.

231
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:55,219
We need to get Obsidian into
every American household,

232
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,091
and we are so close.

233
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:58,962
Quite close, indeed.

234
00:10:59,006 --> 00:11:01,704
Wha-- what a pleasant surprise!

235
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:02,836
-Hi!
-Hello!

236
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:06,535
Team, this is Gemma Cooper,

237
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,320
one of our board members
and my beloved college mentor.

238
00:11:09,364 --> 00:11:11,018
-That's all. Thank you.

239
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,978
Okay, it took some
technical doing,

240
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,632
but I believe
I've confirmed that--

241
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,591
We are the only Brainiac-5s
that came through the wormhole,

242
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:21,985
which you've now traced
to Al's Bar.

243
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:24,248
Yeah, we, too, deduced that

244
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,121
several moments ago,
but hey, Al's bar,

245
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:30,167
I do love
their margarita mocktails.

246
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,691
Perhaps we should go...

247
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:36,347
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

248
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,827
Prime, help me
root out the virus.

249
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:40,177
How? Uh, I don't...

250
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,618
Okay. It's okay. That's okay.
I got you. Here we go.

251
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,493
-Okay.

252
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,538
You know, I could have
died just there.

253
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:55,062
Thanks to your hesitancy.

254
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,673
We're supposed to believe
that he's a Brainiac-5!

255
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,676
Friends, friends, focus.

256
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,461
The virus is transmittable
from anywhere.

257
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:04,898
Any one of us could be next.

258
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:08,292
You, stay here.

259
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:11,252
We'll head down to Al's bar.
We'll get to the bottom
of this.

260
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,517
-Okay.
-There he goes.

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,737
Handsome. Look at him go.

262
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:25,745
I'll go get Supergirl.

263
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,750
Hey, what's going on here...

264
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:32,882
Als.

265
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,754
Everybody just showed up
out of the blue last night.

266
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,190
Business has never been better.

267
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,321
I had to open up the back room.

268
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,062
Has this place
always been here?

269
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:42,805
-Yup. I closed it in '79
after disco died.
-How old are you?

270
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,460
-Shh.
-These guys brought a ton
of stuff with them, though.

271
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:49,812
-You guys missing anything?
- What fun!

272
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:57,472
Look, whatever caused
that wormhole

273
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,954
didn't just drag us through,
it dragged everyone
from Al's bar

274
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:03,304
in each of our universes.

275
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,872
Oh, dear.
Are those...

276
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:08,744
Don't make
any sudden movements.

277
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,746
Those are the witches
that created Reign.

278
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,617
And tried to terraform
our entire planet.

279
00:13:12,661 --> 00:13:14,794
Those aren't your witches.

280
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:16,796
They come from my world.

281
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,668
They came
to National City as tourists
and never left.

282
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,844
I let them run a little
side hustle out of the bar.

283
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,933
Come forth, my children.

284
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,587
Have your fortune read.

285
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,546
I prefer to avoid such
unreliable forecasting
mechanisms.

286
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,505
Crystals balls! Ha-ha.

287
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,638
A lot more real
than fool's gold.

288
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:37,077
Allow me to read your stones.

289
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,080
Please, forgive my sisters.

290
00:13:41,342 --> 00:13:44,780
Palm reading is the
fastest path to your fate.

291
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:49,089
Five dollars, ten minutes.

292
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,266
Hmm, no thank you.

293
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,921
-Uh, suit yourself.
-Typical.

294
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,488
No one on this Earth
values our gifts.

295
00:13:57,532 --> 00:14:00,404
Everyone in this bar
came from an Earth
that was destroyed.

296
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,710
They're all orphans.

297
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,582
That's terrible.

298
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,671
No, Supergirl!

299
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:09,849
The entire multi-verse
was destroyed.

300
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:13,330
An accident of fate kept
us and these people alive.

301
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,072
This isn't a tragedy.

302
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:18,814
It's a, you know,
it's a miracle.

303
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,078
Okay, we need
to divide and conquer.

304
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,646
And please, try to blend in,

305
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:26,691
because there is still
a murderer out there

306
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,824
and both of you are
still in danger. Okay?

307
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,784
Good.

308
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:44,057
I never thought I'd
live to see the day

309
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,362
my mother wore petal pink.

310
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:46,886
Technically, you didn't.

311
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,192
We all died. We all came back.

312
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,411
And we both know it.

313
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,195
Lex restored
your memories, too.

314
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,284
He told me everything.

315
00:14:54,328 --> 00:14:57,940
But, evidently,
the only person he makes
deals with gods for is you.

316
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,074
I'm glad
he told you everything.

317
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,728
I have no one else.

318
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,469
I hope you're
not looking for a hug.

319
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:10,474
No. But it occurred to me
I could use a partner.

320
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:14,261
If Lex told you everything,
then he told you my goal was
to fix people at their core.

321
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,873
I tried to do it alone.

322
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,745
I closed myself off,
made myself an island,
and I failed.

323
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:23,748
You pushed people away
and put all your faith
in that robot.

324
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,231
Reminds me
of little Miss Pizzly.

325
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,059
Your teddy bear
from when you were four.

326
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,974
Cute and useless.

327
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:35,108
We both know your ideology
is of no use to me.

328
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:38,067
I've got
a good thing going here.

329
00:15:38,111 --> 00:15:39,286
Well, in that case...

330
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:42,680
Supergirl wants
to partner with me.

331
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:46,075
Part of me wants to do it.

332
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:50,514
You can try to only be
partners this time,

333
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,734
but in a moment of weakness,

334
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,302
you'll let your guard down,
you'll become friends
once more,

335
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:58,783
and you'll be vulnerable
when she hurts you
all over again.

336
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:02,178
And yet,
you don't want to be an island.

337
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,224
No.

338
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,704
I will never trust Lex again.

339
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,402
If you choose
to partner with Lex,

340
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,319
you won't risk your emotions,

341
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:14,364
because you already know
you can never trust him.

342
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:19,239
I report to Lex Luthor.

343
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:22,024
This is worst-case scenario.

344
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,462
I don't know how I'm supposed
to work for him,

345
00:16:25,506 --> 00:16:27,464
and yet we all know
that he's this bomb

346
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:29,205
that could just blow
at any minute.

347
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,555
So, I mean,
can I even really leave?

348
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,993
You know, long before
I recruited you,

349
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:37,909
an alien named Izzy was held
captive by her co-worker.

350
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,694
Now, he'd found out
what she really was

351
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,913
and couldn't control his rage.

352
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,438
Izzy was naturally terrified.

353
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,744
But because
her attacker was human,

354
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,659
the DEO didn't have
jurisdiction.

355
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,096
Things were different
back then.

356
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,055
I felt so helpless.

357
00:16:53,969 --> 00:16:55,536
So what did you do?

358
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,320
What I knew I had to do.

359
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,322
I disobeyed orders.

360
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:03,674
Ran in there and tackled
that man to the ground myself.

361
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:08,244
Sometimes there's nothing to do
but listen to the truth
inside you, Alex.

362
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:11,247
The honor comes in running
toward the bomb.

363
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:44,759
Seven hundred
and sixty-two bottles of beer
on the wall.

364
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,761
And they're all completely
lacking in clues.

365
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,024
Talking to yourself.

366
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:51,896
You can talk to me
instead, if you'd like.

367
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,202
I'm you, after all.

368
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:54,986
Ignored us all day,
and now you want to talk.

369
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,119
I see you.

370
00:17:57,163 --> 00:18:00,209
You've been one step behind
the rest of us at every turn.

371
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,863
What is making you different?

372
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,953
It's not a big deal
or anything,

373
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:07,434
but I do wear...

374
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:13,788
Personality inhibiters.

375
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:15,006
I knew it.

376
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,837
Why would you wear those?

377
00:18:20,969 --> 00:18:22,927
-For protection.
-Protection?

378
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:26,888
Personality inhibitors
block you from engaging
with the big brain.

379
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,325
They stop you from accessing
your true self.

380
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,632
Your true potential,
your true happiness.

381
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:36,289
Don't you ever
feel inconsistent?

382
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,943
Uncertain?
Unable to balance logic
and emotion?

383
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:41,381
I mean, look at you,
you're not even green.

384
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:44,297
Okay, sure.
And what about the anger?

385
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,776
Hmm? The rage?

386
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,083
I don't wear these
to protect myself!

387
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,085
I wear them to protect
the people I love.

388
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:54,611
Where I'm from, I was married.

389
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:58,137
I was stronger, smarter,
better, every moment
I was with her.

390
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,836
-You lost her?
-No.

391
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:04,708
She's with me.

392
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,148
She lives on in the big brain.

393
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:12,673
Just as I will,
when my work here is finished.

394
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:19,723
What I'm saying
is love is not meant
to minimize you.

395
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:22,378
It makes you more.

396
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:25,120
More capable.
More compassionate.

397
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,687
And the people
who really love you,

398
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:30,821
they don't want this for you.

399
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,305
I appreciate the chat, Kor-El,

400
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,352
but I feel very capable
as I am.

401
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,309
Suit yourself.

402
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,053
A hologram, this whole time.

403
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,491
Now I see how rude that is.

404
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:54,193
I always thought
my Brainy was one of a kind.

405
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,893
I'm sorry, I'm Nia.

406
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,808
My Brainy filled me in
on everything

407
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,767
and I just had to see
you all for myself.

408
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,510
I brought lunch. You hungry?

409
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:10,426
No, I...  sorry.

410
00:20:11,427 --> 00:20:15,301
I just wanna
be alone right now.

411
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:18,042
He also said something
about a bottle.

412
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:20,436
A bottle.

413
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,533
Alas...

414
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,756
You have caught me in the act.

415
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:36,974
But I'm glad.

416
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,499
The act was

417
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,763
emotionally exhausting.

418
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:46,549
What's in the bottle?

419
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,551
Seven billion souls
on my Earth.

420
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:51,728
All here.

421
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,426
Bottled at the source.

422
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:56,385
Moments before
the antimatter wave came.

423
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:00,476
No more waiting.

424
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,958
Sweet release.

425
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,787
You bottled your world.

426
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,049
I saved them.

427
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:13,576
Prevented genocide.

428
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,101
Now, stuck in stasis,
is that truly life?

429
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,409
Or is it just

430
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:23,499
some hideous form
of distasteful death?

431
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,196
Why don't we take it upstairs?

432
00:21:26,459 --> 00:21:28,417
We can hash out the
philosophy there.

433
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:30,332
There is nothing to hash.

434
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:31,594
There is only life.

435
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,381
And death.

436
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:41,300
Take the other Brainiac-5.

437
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:44,651
He tried to prevent me
from opening this bottle,
so I killed him.

438
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:45,695
Death!

439
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:49,569
But once I find the device

440
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,006
with which to open
this bottle,

441
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:55,401
life...

442
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:02,843
Brainy!

443
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:06,629
Nia.

444
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:21,514
No!

445
00:22:24,386 --> 00:22:25,256
Nia.

446
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:36,529
He was piggybacking off
Brainy Prime's
personality inhibitors

447
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:39,488
to confuse the big brain
and disguise
his true intentions.

448
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:40,968
What were his intentions?

449
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,361
He shrunk his entire Earth.

450
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,233
He bottled it.

451
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:47,496
The shrinking and collection
of worlds is distinctly Coluan.

452
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,977
It's a terribly common practice
among our ancestors.

453
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,502
But this Brainy bottled
his world to protect it?

454
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:55,548
Yeah, but if he releases
his Earth,

455
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,201
both Earths will be destroyed.

456
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,855
But he couldn't
open the bottle.

457
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,596
Indeed, all bottles are sealed
beneath the quantum level to--

458
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,468
Prevent escape.

459
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:06,210
Bottles can only be opened
using a device that harnesses
Argonium 44.

460
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:09,300
He must have known the Argonium
Saber would be held here
at the DEO.

461
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,520
That saber is the only one
that I am aware of
in the solar system.

462
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:14,393
And I destroyed it,
so that bought us some time.

463
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:16,743
Brainy.

464
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:21,225
It's incredible.

465
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,923
It's like being
on the moon.

466
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,882
Except for the lack
of gravity.

467
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,449
We're still figuring that out.

468
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,016
But we're making
incredible progress.

469
00:23:32,715 --> 00:23:36,589
Progress isn't just Obsidian
being in every household.

470
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:39,418
It's about every household
being in Obsidian.

471
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,943
-What do you mean?
-Tell me something.

472
00:23:42,986 --> 00:23:44,858
If you never had to work
for your father,

473
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,036
what would Andrea Rojas
want to be right now?

474
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,037
An anthropologist.

475
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:54,345
Oh, I love it.

476
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:57,436
You can live on
a sprawling hacienda,

477
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,786
close to your latest
Aztec dig site.

478
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:02,963
-It's a pleasant dream.
-Not a dream.

479
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:07,228
A reality.
In a true virtual world.

480
00:24:07,271 --> 00:24:10,579
When someone holds
an artifact that you found,

481
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:13,539
they feel its weight
in their actual hand.

482
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,063
Imagine a whole new world,

483
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,631
a whole new reality for

484
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,459
harmed and damaged people.

485
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,463
They can live
their dream lives.

486
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:29,424
And eventually,
they could stay there.

487
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,644
Indefinitely.

488
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:34,516
A collective of being.

489
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,564
A true virtual world
will change the game.

490
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:39,782
What do I always tell you?

491
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,002
You gotta move the needle.

492
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:44,352
And with this...

493
00:24:45,788 --> 00:24:47,747
Our share prices could double.

494
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:53,927
Brainy, stop.
You don't have to...

495
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:00,020
When I was eight years old,

496
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:03,153
my family went on...

497
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:07,114
what humans might
call a vacation.

498
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:10,378
This was the first time
I had seen the snow.

499
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,684
It was incredible.

500
00:25:13,207 --> 00:25:14,338
Why are you telling me this?

501
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:20,214
'Cause my mother saw
how much I loved it.

502
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,432
How badly I...

503
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,914
I wanted to stay there
in the snow.

504
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:30,833
And so, she bottled it for me.

505
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:34,533
-The entire planet.
-Brainy...

506
00:25:34,576 --> 00:25:37,797
My father was horrified
at what she had done.

507
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,928
He freed the planet.

508
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:43,193
I was so young
and angry with him...

509
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:48,547
for taking away my planet.

510
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,592
My planet!

511
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:53,595
And that anger terrified him.

512
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:57,120
He feared that I, too,
could hold such
darkness within me.

513
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,472
That I could become my mother.

514
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,741
So he placed three
personality inhibitors on me.

515
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,832
The same ones I wear
to this very day.

516
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,050
Your three dots.

517
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,270
When I wear them,
I'm not fully calibrated

518
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:19,360
with the Coluan network
of minds, the big brain.

519
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:23,625
If I hadn't been wearing them,

520
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:27,237
that bad Brainy wouldn't
have been able to fool us.

521
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:28,717
And you're afraid
to take them off?

522
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:31,285
Because I might be worse.
And Nia, she...

523
00:26:33,113 --> 00:26:34,505
She might not care for me.

524
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:36,464
Brainy, you are good
to your core.

525
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:38,727
You will never be your mother.

526
00:26:38,771 --> 00:26:40,903
-How could you be sure?
-Because you're loved.

527
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:44,385
And the people that love you
will always fight for you.

528
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,129
Thank you, Kara.

529
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:54,700
Your ability to instill hope
and comfort with
your words is...

530
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:57,311
is nothing short of magic.

531
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:02,229
-Magic.
- The witches
can open the bottle.

532
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,447
He's going to Al's.

533
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,668
We have to tell
the other Brainys.

534
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,063
No, I, I need to do this alone.

535
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,154
-But you should come, too.
-I'm coming.

536
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,561
Why are you helping him?

537
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:32,825
You could have
a peaceful life here.

538
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:35,218
The Crisis brought us
to a strange world.

539
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:38,134
If the Coluan is successful,
he will return us home.

540
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,484
Opening that bottle
isn't worth the risk.

541
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:42,922
Yes, it is.

542
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,445
You could kill everyone.

543
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,229
Why should this Earth live,

544
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,710
when every other died?

545
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:50,277
'Cause it's the only one
we've got left!

546
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,192
Enough talk.

547
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:55,325
It's been ages since we had
a good bar fight.

548
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:06,423
Wait!

549
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:21,656
We can't undo the past.

550
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,570
Watch us.

551
00:28:39,805 --> 00:28:41,502
-Brainy.

552
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:53,296
-Brainy.

553
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,602
This is all my fault.

554
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,489
Brainy, it's okay.

555
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:15,884
You can take them off.

556
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:21,237
But what if I turn...

557
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:25,067
No matter what happens,
I love you.

558
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:08,807
No, don't!

559
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,506
I know you lost
your whole world,

560
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:15,248
your friends, your home.

561
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,077
I miss what I had, too.

562
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,296
I know what
you're going through.

563
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,082
How responsible you must feel.

564
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,735
You don't know anything!

565
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:32,700
But I know everything
because I'm you.

566
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,443
I feel the darkness, too.

567
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:41,622
You've made some bad choices,
but they don't have
to define you.

568
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,848
I lost everything.

569
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,549
It's not too late
to make a different choice.

570
00:30:58,247 --> 00:30:59,466
Let us help you.

571
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:06,212
My friends and I,
we're pretty smart.

572
00:31:06,255 --> 00:31:09,737
Together, we can find a safe
place to open your bottle

573
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,738
without hurting anyone.

574
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,002
The suave one
is right.

575
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:16,483
It is too much of a risk.

576
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,050
But if we give these people
a chance,

577
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:21,662
they may find a way
of returning us home one day.

578
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:23,403
All we can do
is wait for that day.

579
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,232
But you don't
have to wait alone,

580
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,495
we can wait with you.

581
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:25,944
Supergirl and Dreamer are
bringing the bottle to
the fortress for safekeeping.

582
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:29,817
Which solves the problem
of one errant Brainiac-5.

583
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:32,602
We were thinking that, too.

584
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:41,872
Life projectors.

585
00:32:42,612 --> 00:32:44,963
Our worlds may be gone,

586
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:48,140
but the big brain remains.

587
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:54,885
A digital cloud where
Ms. Dox and I can relinquish
our corporeal forms

588
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:57,584
and live amongst the Coluan
knowledge aggregate.

589
00:32:57,627 --> 00:32:59,455
-You don't have to do that.
-We want to.

590
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,022
We may have lost our worlds,

591
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:04,983
but existing inside
of the big brain
will feel like...

592
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,333
like going home.

593
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:09,030
Thank you.

594
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:10,945
Both of you.

595
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,339
For everything.

596
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,732
Thank you, Brainiac-5,

597
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:19,345
and, uh, sorry for trying
to take your smoothie.

598
00:33:38,755 --> 00:33:40,757
What a strange sensation.

599
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:42,020
There's something
you need to know.

600
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:48,809
The reason I left the two
of you to face today's
threat alone

601
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:52,291
is because I've been tracking
Lex Luthor's every move.

602
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:56,860
He's been calling the archive
for information on only
one thing, Leviathan.

603
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,079
Leviathan is defeated.

604
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:00,342
Leviathan is everywhere.

605
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:04,042
The timeline of our worlds
is closer than any other.

606
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:06,174
Events progress
on the same path.

607
00:34:06,218 --> 00:34:08,002
You must not make
the same mistakes I made.

608
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,876
I fought against Lex Luthor,

609
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,965
and it led to catastrophe
beyond imagining.

610
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,142
It endangered the entire world.

611
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:19,187
If you're gonna save
your world,

612
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:23,191
you have to work
with Lex Luthor.

613
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,150
I'll show you everything
you need to know.

614
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:27,630
I'll show you everything I did
wrong in my world,
how bad things became.

615
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,764
But Kor-El.

616
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:35,899
Kor-El, you must do this alone.

617
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:38,380
No one can know
that you're doing this.

618
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:42,515
You must give up everyone
and everything that
you hold dear.

619
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:43,994
Even Nia?

620
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:47,650
Till the world has been saved.

621
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:49,783
I'm sorry.

622
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:52,090
Kor-El,

623
00:34:53,439 --> 00:34:55,093
you'll never truly be alone.

624
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,275
-I will be with you.

625
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:29,649
Aren't you supposed to be
at a ceremony or something?

626
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:33,131
Success isn't worth much
if you don't have anyone
to share it with.

627
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:37,265
I always wanted to share
my victories with you, sis.

628
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:41,095
Even last year,
with the Kasnians,
I brought you in.

629
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,923
Doesn't that count
for anything?

630
00:35:42,966 --> 00:35:46,187
One moment of thoughtfulness
to make up for
years of betrayal? No.

631
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:48,320
I know you have plenty
of reasons to distrust me,

632
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:49,582
but you don't know
what it's like to...

633
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:53,934
die.

634
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:56,632
The sickening desperation
when you see it coming for you.

635
00:35:56,676 --> 00:35:57,981
It made me want to lash out.

636
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:00,810
It made me want to hurt you.

637
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:02,464
Like I hurt you.

638
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:05,902
Killed me.
But that's exactly my point.

639
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:08,905
Death truly has changed me.

640
00:36:08,949 --> 00:36:12,692
The old me would be dreaming
of the myriad ways I could
exact my revenge on you,

641
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:17,523
but the new me can see
how pathetically pedestrian
that is.

642
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:21,353
I'm finally ready to be
a true partner, Lena.

643
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,055
How am I supposed
to believe you?

644
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,406
You were a sociopath, a liar.

645
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,669
What you need is the truth.

646
00:36:41,982 --> 00:36:44,724
The Truth Seeker will prevent
me from lying.

647
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:52,210
So, sis, what do you
want to know?

648
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,124
Can you help me
achieve Non Nocere?

649
00:36:54,168 --> 00:36:55,996
Better and faster
than anybody else.

650
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,303
Will you truly be
on your best behavior?
No homicides?

651
00:36:58,346 --> 00:37:00,218
No unnecessary homicides.

652
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,002
This is about doing no harm.

653
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:05,005
But I won't. I have everything
I want except for
your partnership.

654
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,398
When will you turn on me?

655
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,227
As soon as this partnership
inconveniences me.

656
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:12,360
Just like you'll use
Non Nocere on me
as soon as you get the chance.

657
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,581
Good. As long as we're clear.

658
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:22,327
You don't need me.
Why do you really want
to work with me?

659
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,284
Truthfully,

660
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:26,244
I don't want to be alone.

661
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,125
-Hey.
-Hello.

662
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:41,520
How do you feel?

663
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:45,001
-Uninhibited?
-Something like that.

664
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:48,440
You know, I'm really glad
to see you so comfortable
in your own skin.

665
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,270
It's all I ever
really wanted for you

666
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:55,229
was to be able to be yourself.

667
00:37:58,014 --> 00:38:00,103
And now I am.

668
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:02,715
I can feel it,
all through my body.

669
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:03,890
The tips of my fingers.

670
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:09,461
And now, some things
are gonna have to change, Nia.

671
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:12,638
Of course. Look, Brainy,
whatever you need,

672
00:38:12,681 --> 00:38:13,595
we'll work it out.

673
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,641
Together.

674
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:19,209
Together... that's...

675
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,430
That's what has to change.

676
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:25,477
-What?
-I can't be with
you anymore.

677
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:30,830
I don't understand.

678
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:37,663
Who are you?

679
00:38:42,058 --> 00:38:45,061
For the first time, ever,

680
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:49,239
myself.

681
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,387
Welcome, everyone.

682
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,389
It gives me great pleasure
to be here tonight.

683
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,348
Hey, what are
you doing over here?

684
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,045
I just, uh...

685
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:16,658
Look, I know you're gonna
think I'm crazy,

686
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:19,661
but I'm not so sure Lex Luthor
is what he says he is.

687
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:22,011
-What?
- ...with the deeds
of just a few people...

688
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:26,189
I thought you loved him
like everyone else.

689
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,627
While I was still
at The Timesin London,

690
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:31,064
Lex tried to buy my friend,
Russell Roger's company.

691
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:35,373
Russell refused
and ended up dead.

692
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:39,028
I think Lex Luthor
was behind it.

693
00:39:39,072 --> 00:39:40,508
Do you have
any concrete evidence?

694
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:42,162
Not yet.

695
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,077
That's why I applied
to work at CatCo,

696
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,863
to get closer to Lena Luthor,
but then she sold the company
to Andrea,

697
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:51,867
and now, I could use your help.

698
00:39:51,911 --> 00:39:54,392
But someone has to protect
the world from the Luthors.

699
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:57,786
Not the Luthors, Lex.

700
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,964
I know Lena. She's in just
as much danger
as everyone else.

701
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:05,490
The guest of honor and I
have already accomplished
so much in the past.

702
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:08,318
And I'm looking forward
to seeing what we will
achieve in the future.

703
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,278
She was leaning towards
the Kryptonian.

704
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,238
-You're welcome.
-You're too good to me.

705
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:17,589
We were partners
when we took over
the last world...

706
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:19,373
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce...

707
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,375
...why shouldn't we be partners
in this one, too?

708
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,464
...my brother,
my partner,

709
00:40:23,508 --> 00:40:25,727
Lex Luthor,
the Man of Tomorrow.

710
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:38,305
Oh, how can I help you,
Agent Dox?

711
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:42,004
My friends
will work against you.

712
00:40:44,093 --> 00:40:46,182
You know it. I know it.

713
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:50,273
But they're shortsighted.

714
00:40:50,317 --> 00:40:51,840
The true threat. The...

715
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:56,454
The only threat that matters
is Leviathan.

716
00:40:58,717 --> 00:41:00,283
I'd like to help you
defeat them.

717
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:01,241
Well...

718
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:04,070
that's good to hear.

719
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,772
But no information
about Leviathan exists

720
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:11,904
in this new world...

721
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,167
at this time.

722
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,126
I need knowledge
from the future.

723
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,264
I have reason to believe
a particular doppelganger
came through the wormhole.

724
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:27,876
He's already been arrested,
but if we play our cards right,

725
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:32,272
we can bring the future to us.
