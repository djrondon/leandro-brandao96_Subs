1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,480
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:04,091
My brother was a traitor.

3
00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:05,396
He poisoned us.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,355
Perhaps if I can access
more of my memories,

5
00:00:07,398 --> 00:00:09,748
I might be able to uncover
what his next move will be.

6
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:11,185
Kelly, do you think
we can go deeper

7
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:12,664
with Obsidian's tech?

8
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,710
That kind of power
could re-set your brain
for good.

9
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:20,629
The power to incept
was stolen from me
in the Phantom Zone.

10
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,631
That woman gave you the answer.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,329
Eve, meet Hope.

12
00:00:25,373 --> 00:00:27,331
You two are going to be working
closely together.

13
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,682
I see you.
You're a saboteur.

14
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,771
That's a rotten way
of making it to the top.

15
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,742
Hey, Jarrod.

16
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,658
Blowing me off
was not a smart move.

17
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,922
Was I unclear
the first 12 times?

18
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,358
I'm not interested.

19
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:57,100
If you don't work with us,
this will end very badly.

20
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,667
You're going with threats?

21
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,234
You should see
what my board
threatens me with

22
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:01,583
every other Tuesday.

23
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,368
You're making a mistake.

24
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:34,790
Thanks, Jenny.

25
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,357
The next time your sister
asks you to babysit,

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,401
just say no.

27
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,055
Remember, boundaries.

28
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:43,407
Speaking of boundaries,
do you even know that woman?

29
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,582
I just met her, why?

30
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:46,628
She just told you
her whole life story?

31
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,412
It's kind of my job
to listen, guys.

32
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:51,328
Kelly, you were attacked
by a shapeshifter.

33
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,721
And he's still out there.

34
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:56,116
And you have every DEO agent
working to find him.

35
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,334
I don't think it could hurt

36
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:59,510
to reel it in
just until they catch him.

37
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:01,208
And as Alex's sister,

38
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,862
I can tell you
that she's almost always
annoyingly right.

39
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:05,647
And as Kelly's brother,
I can tell you

40
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,822
that she can handle herself.

41
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,608
Listen, I hate to break up
this Danvers-Olsen scrimmage,

42
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:12,697
but we have to get
to our meeting.

43
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:14,873
- All right.
-Try not to worry so much.

44
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:16,962
-Okay.
-Okay.

45
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,399
-Bye.
-Bye.

46
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:21,880
Any sign of Malefic?

47
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:24,448
No. He doesn't seem to have
any psychic signature either.

48
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:26,146
But we'll find him.
We have to.

49
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,019
Oh! You... You all right?

50
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,763
Maybe I'm a little nervous
about having lunch with Lena.

51
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,112
It's the first time
we're hanging out

52
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,461
since I told her
I was Supergirl.

53
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:40,116
I was just
lying to her for so long.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,987
Kara, Lena forgave you.

55
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:44,599
Okay? So you're going to have
to just let go of the past.

56
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,818
I just want things
to be great between us.

57
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:49,299
I... And I want
this lunch to be--

58
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,213
Perfect.

59
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,171
Yes.

60
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:52,215
And it will.

61
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,303
Look, Lena wants
your relationship

62
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,218
back on track, too.

63
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:57,177
Look, I have to get back
to the DEO.

64
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,657
You go be perfect
somewhere else.

65
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:00,354
I'll try.

66
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,485
Okay.

67
00:03:10,973 --> 00:03:11,843
Damn it!

68
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:17,371
The transmitter you duplicated
from the Obsidian contacts

69
00:03:17,414 --> 00:03:19,329
uses an ocular interface.

70
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:21,505
Since you modeled it
directly into the brain,

71
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:23,290
may I suggest
you lower the frequency

72
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,205
another 7.32%?

73
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,249
It's not that, Hope.

74
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,685
In theory,
Q-waves should allow me

75
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:29,731
to rewrite portions
of the human brain.

76
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,081
To rid the world of lying,
manipulation and violence.

77
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,518
Yes, but no matter
how I manipulate the frequency,

78
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:35,998
the transmitter
will only allow me

79
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,087
to read information
from the brain.

80
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,437
If I try to augment it,
I get a zombie effect.

81
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,352
And you don't want
a world of robots.

82
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,701
You just want better people.

83
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:44,659
Right.

84
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,495
I am sorry, Ms. Luthor.

85
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,323
It must be uncomfortable,

86
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,499
with me in this form,
for you to trust me.

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,284
I don't trust people, Hope.

88
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:02,590
I believed I could once.

89
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,896
I had friends
that made me believe I could.

90
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,116
But they betrayed me
like everyone else.

91
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,422
Your brother, Lex,

92
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:09,553
was the worst of them.

93
00:04:09,597 --> 00:04:11,425
But I believe
he could help you now.

94
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,557
I have access to
Eve Tessmacher's memories.

95
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,429
Lex was working with Q-waves.

96
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,691
It was part of his plan

97
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,084
to get past
Superman's invulnerable skin.

98
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,826
He left detailed records
in his private journals.

99
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,437
His journals?

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,568
There are three of them.

101
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:25,961
They are currently

102
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,094
in a level five secure facility
at Fort Summit.

103
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,621
However, upon further analysis,

104
00:04:33,664 --> 00:04:35,449
retrieving them
would be impossible.

105
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,846
For me, maybe, but...

106
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,153
not for everyone.

107
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,594
Graceful arcs across her brow

108
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:53,771
I'm left forever to wonder how

109
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:56,948
A being as perfect
as my Nia Nal

110
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:58,776
Could ever love

111
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,082
-Someone as small...
-Put up with this all.

112
00:05:02,127 --> 00:05:02,954
What was that?

113
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,782
Um, just thank you

114
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:07,611
for poem one hundred and--

115
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,830
One hundred and twenty-seven.

116
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:10,658
One hundred and twenty-seven.

117
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,616
Yes, I've almost
mastered the sonnet.

118
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,792
Oh, I think you've got it.

119
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:17,099
But you don't wanna
overdo it.

120
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,666
You're right.

121
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:22,713
Brevity is the soul of wit,
as Polonius said to Hamlet.

122
00:05:22,757 --> 00:05:26,108
Now I shall move on
to the villanelle.

123
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,457
A more complicated form,

124
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:30,939
but capable of much deeper
emotional resonance,

125
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:34,159
as exemplified by Dylan Thomas'
"Don't go gentle--"

126
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,641
Nia.

127
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,382
All right,
what's next on the docket?

128
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:41,428
Any celebrity divorces?

129
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,168
Disgraced influencers?

130
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,518
Show me the clicks.

131
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:46,346
I've got this week's
medical examiner's report,

132
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:49,653
and I thought we could
run a story on recent deaths.

133
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,525
People love
to read about death.

134
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,917
It reminds them
that they're alive,

135
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,180
and it gives them
the pleasure of schadenfreude.

136
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,051
I like it.

137
00:05:57,748 --> 00:06:00,795
Twenty-year-old Uber driver,
hit by a car.

138
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:03,014
If the person is boring,

139
00:06:03,058 --> 00:06:05,408
then the cause of death
is boring.

140
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:08,585
Wow me.
Show me some sparkly death.

141
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,196
No, no, no...

142
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,241
Um... Oh!

143
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:16,898
Dr. Niles Jarrod,
a health tech billionaire,

144
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:20,031
recently discovered deceased
in a night club bathroom.

145
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:20,945
My God!

146
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,686
Dr. Jarrod died?

147
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,167
I... I interviewed him
last year--

148
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:28,300
For your piece
on the moral implications
of gene manipulation.

149
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,519
Knowing the dead person

150
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,303
does not make
their death interesting.

151
00:06:31,347 --> 00:06:33,218
-Next.
-Wait, wait.

152
00:06:33,262 --> 00:06:34,785
A 33-year-old genius

153
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,832
doing significant work
in the field of extending life

154
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,356
dies young, unexpectedly?

155
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,749
It's tragic.

156
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,446
And certainly worth a story.

157
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,534
There's hard news,

158
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,667
legitimate feature,
or brain candy.

159
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,059
Sentimental tripe
you just pitched us

160
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:51,193
is a category of its own...
Trash.

161
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,237
How dare you--

162
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,369
William's right.

163
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,979
A dead scientist
is not sparkly.

164
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:57,460
And there's
no substantive story.

165
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:58,722
So stop wasting our time.

166
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,507
How do you know
there's no substantive story

167
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,247
when we haven't even
looked into it yet?

168
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:03,379
I've looked into it.

169
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,424
Thoroughly.

170
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,295
Nothing there.

171
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,470
Franklin,

172
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,732
next corpse, please.

173
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,872
Perfect.

174
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:25,749
I think you know more about
the Jarrod story,

175
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:27,751
and for some reason
you don't want me on it.

176
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,752
You're paranoid.

177
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:31,146
You lied up there. Why?

178
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:33,583
Stop humiliating yourself,
Danvers.

179
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,150
It's painful to watch.

180
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,590
I know that braid.

181
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:44,289
-You okay?

182
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:47,510
Yeah. I thought I had
William Dey pegged
as an ambitious ass,

183
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,295
but I think
he might be much worse.

184
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,168
-You remember that piece I did
on genetic engineering?
-Yeah.

185
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,692
Well, my main subject,
Dr. Jarrod,

186
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,346
was found dead in a club.

187
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,087
-Overdose?
-Unclear.

188
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,915
And William Dey
spiked the story.

189
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,482
He said
he'd already looked into it

190
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:03,613
and there was nothing more
to find.

191
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:05,789
-So?
-He was lying.

192
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,444
His heart rate
was through the roof.

193
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,925
He knows something more
about Dr. Jarrod's death,

194
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:12,796
and he doesn't want me
to find out about it.

195
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,668
Sounds like we should
be calling my contact

196
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:16,147
at the M.E.'s office.

197
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:17,409
I'm sorry. We?

198
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,324
Yeah. I mean,
I want to get out of my head

199
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:20,891
about the job offers, and...

200
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:22,763
We may have a murder to solve.

201
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,548
Unless you don't want
a super friend.

202
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:26,593
No, of course I do.

203
00:08:26,636 --> 00:08:28,812
Okay then.
I'll keep you updated.

204
00:08:29,204 --> 00:08:30,553
Okay.

205
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:31,685
Nia, come on in.

206
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,295
J'onn, what is it? Is it Mal?

207
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,340
-No, no, no. Nothing like that.

208
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,520
Another poem.

209
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:44,306
Every hour of every day
Brainy sends a new ode
to a new body part.

210
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,831
Sorry, um, not appropriate.

211
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,833
Or important, right now.

212
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,487
How can I help?

213
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,054
I wanna restore
my missing memories.

214
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,838
I was hoping that you
and your dream power

215
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:57,319
might go deeper
than Kelly's technology could.

216
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,931
Isn't messing with memories
dangerous?

217
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:03,020
No, I believe
that restoring lost memories

218
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,544
through dreams should be safe,

219
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,851
because I will be finding them
myself in an organic way.

220
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:09,244
With your help, of course.

221
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,987
J'onn, are you sure
you want to remember?

222
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:15,990
Malefic said
I was still in the dark.

223
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:19,994
And I believe he's right.

224
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:21,430
And one of those
missing memories

225
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,911
has the key to unlock
why he betrayed our people.

226
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:26,087
Why he's coming after
everybody I care about.

227
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:29,569
If I can truly understand
what happened,

228
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,136
I might be able to stop him.

229
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,171
Pete Andrews?

230
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,652
-What are you doing here?

231
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:10,914
I haven't seen you in, what?

232
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,263
Like two years?

233
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,656
Well, one of the guys
posted something online

234
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,179
about you working here.
So...

235
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,703
That's funny, I just started.

236
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,052
Well, I was in town,

237
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,054
I thought I might drop by
and see your new digs.

238
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:23,448
Kind of fancy, Olsen.

239
00:10:24,406 --> 00:10:26,016
Thanks.

240
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,236
God, it's so cool of you
to stop by.

241
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,150
Dr. Olsen.

242
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,586
Your 1:30 appointment is here.

243
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,632
Yeah. Ugh, I'm sorry.

244
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:34,982
I would so love to catch up,
I just, I can't right now.

245
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,246
Kelly, I came to
National City to see you.

246
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,510
I think...

247
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,296
I think I need help.

248
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,558
Of course.

249
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,953
My last appointment
wraps up around 6:30.

250
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:51,999
Come back then, we'll talk.

251
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,957
Thank you.

252
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,567
You always had
the biggest heart in the world.

253
00:11:05,316 --> 00:11:06,187
Merci.

254
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:08,232
Au revoir.

255
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:10,844
You brought me
coffee eclairs

256
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,585
from Cafe Rue Serret
on the Champs-Elysees?

257
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:15,196
I know they're your favorite.

258
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,806
And the cappuccinos,
did you really go to
Pave in Milan?

259
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,373
It didn't take me that long.

260
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,244
You know, I have really
been missing out
on the perks

261
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:21,811
of having Supergirl
as a best friend.

262
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:24,509
Well, we have a lot
of lost time to make up for.

263
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,773
Yeah, but you know
you don't have to go to Paris

264
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,817
to pick up lunch, Kara.

265
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,645
That's not
what's important to me.

266
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,168
But, these scones from Dublin,

267
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,605
oh, my God,
you can fly these in everyday.

268
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,870
Mmm. So, tell me,
how is CatCo?

269
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,610
Is everything okay?

270
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,351
Is Andrea behaving civilized?

271
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:45,052
Oh, that's not exactly the word
I would use to describe her.

272
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:49,317
Her mandate has been
making CatCo

273
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,232
the most viewed news website
in the world

274
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:55,018
using tactics like pop quizzes
and clickbait.

275
00:11:55,062 --> 00:11:56,716
Kara, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

276
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,807
Yeah, and then she hired
this snake named William Dey.

277
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,243
Wait, William Dey? Really?

278
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,419
He's supposed to be
a really talented journalist.

279
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:08,162
I know, but sadly, talent
doesn't always mean integrity.

280
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:09,816
And I have no idea
what his MO is,

281
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,732
but James is helping me
figure it out.

282
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,298
Enough about me. How are you?

283
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:15,691
Um...

284
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,215
To tell you the truth,

285
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,523
I haven't had the easiest time
of it since Lex.

286
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,178
I've been having nightmares.

287
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,919
I try not to sleep.

288
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,137
Oh, Lena.

289
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,009
Nights are filled
with apocalyptic visions

290
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:31,663
of torture and anguish
at the hands of my brother.

291
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:34,754
Kelly is working
with PTSD patients
at Obsidian North.

292
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,233
Maybe she could help you.

293
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,627
Thank you. But you know
how private a person I am.

294
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,368
Yeah.

295
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:41,499
You know,
the really frustrating part is

296
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,632
I figured out a way
to heal myself.

297
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,808
I mean, do you remember
the journals we found
at Stryker's?

298
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,288
Of course.

299
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,464
Well, reading them is
the only thing that calms me.

300
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:53,773
Somehow, hearing Lex's voice
takes the mystery away.

301
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,252
And the terror.

302
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,646
I just know if I could
read them all then

303
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,170
I would be able to cure myself
of the trauma.

304
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:02,042
Well, then that's what
you have to do.

305
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:04,087
Unfortunately
that is not an option.

306
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:06,698
The government has confiscated
all of Lex's possessions.

307
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:10,180
His technologies, his weapons,
even his childhood journals.

308
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,921
Well, that's ridiculous.

309
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:14,271
You're the only person that
could have an interest in that.

310
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:15,795
Can't you just ask
for them back?

311
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,231
Believe me, I have tried,

312
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,798
but it is all tied up
in bureaucracy and red tape.

313
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,800
My lawyer said I would never
get them out of Fort Summit.

314
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,105
Well, I could get them for you.

315
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:24,281
Kara, don't be ridiculous.

316
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,196
The journals
will help you heal,

317
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,112
and they're only locked up
due to a technicality.

318
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,940
I could go and get them
and no one would ever know.

319
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,855
No, I couldn't ask you
to do that.

320
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,291
You're not asking.

321
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,205
I'm...

322
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:36,859
I'm offering.

323
00:13:36,903 --> 00:13:38,295
-Oh.

324
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,644
Oh, it's James.

325
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:40,732
He's at the M.E.'s office.

326
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,256
That's okay, we can talk later.

327
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,478
Thank you.

328
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:56,923
Hey, we have five minutes.

329
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:58,141
Okay.

330
00:13:58,185 --> 00:13:59,882
You okay? You look like
you robbed a bank.

331
00:13:59,926 --> 00:14:01,057
Robbed a bank?

332
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,364
No, never.
I would never rob anything.

333
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,714
It's, uh...
Just an expression, Kara.

334
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,325
Right.

335
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,458
Okay, healthy
33-year-old male.

336
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:13,069
Cause of death, heart attack.

337
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:15,811
EMTs found him unresponsive
on the bathroom floor

338
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,204
in a nightclub downtown.

339
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,381
There's something there.

340
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:22,905
Is that a...

341
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,646
tattoo?

342
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,690
Inside his heart?

343
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:30,173
How do you get a tattoo
inside your heart?

344
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,873
This is t'fek'lya.
It may taste a little weird.

345
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,048
It's a Martian herb

346
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,093
which aids
in the connection of minds.

347
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,226
Ugh.

348
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,228
No, it's great.

349
00:14:43,578 --> 00:14:44,492
You ready?

350
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:46,233
Let's do this.

351
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,645
Get him! Get him!

352
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:09,256
I don't understand.
What is this?

353
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,910
Why are they in human form?

354
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,737
Your memories
are being filtered

355
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,869
through my subconscious

356
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,479
in a way
that makes sense to me.

357
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,220
J'onn, wait up.

358
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,354
J'onn, I think that's you.

359
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:22,965
Let's play hide and seek.

360
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,967
J'onn, you're it.

361
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,882
I remember playing this game.

362
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,583
There.

363
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:35,760
-Nice job.

364
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,327
Malefic, you go now.

365
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,989
He cannot connect
to the hive mind.

366
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,121
He can't do it.

367
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,080
-What's wrong with you?
-He can't do anything.

368
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,393
Stop it, Malefic!

369
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:04,789
Sleep.

370
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,973
I thought
the White Martians

371
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,583
used some kind of technology

372
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,412
to turn Malefic
into a terrible weapon,

373
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,501
but he was born that way.

374
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,285
Born able to project
his thoughts

375
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,331
and his will on others, but...

376
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:28,552
cut off from my people
in the cruelest way.

377
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,426
Where are we going, Papa?

378
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:35,385
Where no one
can hurt you, my son.

379
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:45,830
My beautiful son,
know that you are loved

380
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:49,138
and that we will
pray for you everyday

381
00:16:49,182 --> 00:16:52,054
as you must pray yourself.

382
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:56,319
Look to H'ronmeer's teachings
for guidance and healing.

383
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:59,453
Let his counsel
lighten your pain,

384
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:02,717
so that he might
deliver us to a better place.

385
00:17:06,895 --> 00:17:08,810
Father! J'onn!

386
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:10,203
Don't leave me here!

387
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,466
I'll be good. I promise.

388
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:15,164
Our god will
never forsake you.

389
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,732
Malefic, I love you.

390
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,388
Please...

391
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,043
Don't leave me here.

392
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:25,392
I'll do anything.

393
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,227
Malefic, it's J'onn.

394
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,664
Father prays
for your healing everyday.

395
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:40,407
He has faith that...

396
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,670
one day you will return
home to us.

397
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,368
H'ronmeer is not
my salvation, brother.

398
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,980
They are.

399
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:51,070
H'ronmeer...

400
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:55,944
I failed you
as I failed my own son.

401
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,686
Allowed Malefic

402
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:01,080
to be conscripted
by the White Martians,

403
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:05,954
allowed the council
to send him to that purgatory.

404
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:09,436
The agony in my heart...

405
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:13,309
It's...

406
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:16,443
Unbearable.

407
00:18:28,977 --> 00:18:30,152
In my father's anguish,

408
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:32,415
he must have wiped
both our memories.

409
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,419
Wiped my brother
from existence.

410
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,595
J'onn...

411
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,381
Of course Malefic turned
against his own people.

412
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:44,340
The isolation,

413
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,126
the betrayal he must have felt.

414
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,826
He wasn't evil,
he was a child.

415
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:53,828
He needed our help.

416
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:57,005
And then my father goes
and compounds the tragedy by...

417
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,878
wiping his memory
from the collective.

418
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,533
For Martians,
death isn't final,

419
00:19:03,577 --> 00:19:05,361
but erasing a memory is.

420
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,583
It's as if my father...

421
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:12,412
murdered his own son.

422
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,068
And the hypocrisy.

423
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:19,680
His whole life

424
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:22,117
was about being a holy man.

425
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,295
And then he goes and...

426
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,950
commits our culture's
greatest sin.

427
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:37,132
Where are the dumplings?

428
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,220
Oh, shoot!

429
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,179
I totally forgot
to put the order in.

430
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,267
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,790
I just got caught up
investigating

432
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,575
the weird death of this guy
with a tattoo on his heart.

433
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:46,533
Oh.

434
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:47,969
Okay.

435
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:49,492
I can see why you
forgot the dumplings.

436
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:50,406
All's forgiven.

437
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,668
Yeah, but there's more.

438
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:53,670
William Dey, he knows
something about it,

439
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:56,891
and he actively tried
blocking me
from getting involved.

440
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:59,546
Well, it sounds like
a really good story, right?

441
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:01,809
And this guy's always been
very competitive with you.

442
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:04,028
Do you think he's trying to
just steal the scoop
for himself?

443
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:06,422
Maybe. But something
just doesn't feel right.

444
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:08,381
As fascinated as I am
by a dead guy

445
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:10,383
with a tattooed heart,
I am far more interested

446
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,211
in hearing about
your lunch with Lena.

447
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,255
How did it go?

448
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:14,778
Uh... It was great.

449
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:16,998
-Uh-oh.
-Great.

450
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:17,912
Oh, no.

451
00:20:17,955 --> 00:20:18,869
What happened?

452
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:20,262
Nothing.

453
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,873
I flew to Paris,
Milan, Dublin,

454
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,266
I got all
of her favorite things.

455
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,224
It was...

456
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,051
Great.

457
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,402
So why does it look like
you ran over a puppy?

458
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:32,100
It was nothing.
Really. I...

459
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,712
I just... I kind of
spontaneously agreed to...

460
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,888
do a favor for Lena.

461
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,368
Okay. So, what's wrong
with that?

462
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:41,588
Nothing. It just entails...

463
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,807
Breaking into
a secure Army facility

464
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,418
and stealing
Lex Luthor's journals.

465
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:46,549
What?

466
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,725
Kara, are you
out of your mind?

467
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,161
I just blurted it out.

468
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,554
I wasn't thinking.

469
00:20:51,598 --> 00:20:53,382
But, you should have seen
how much pain she was in,

470
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,776
and she's so traumatized
by Lex's death,

471
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,734
and the journals
are the only way

472
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:58,909
-she can find closure.
-No.

473
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,346
You're going to call her
right now,

474
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:01,695
and you're going to tell her
that you made a mistake.

475
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:03,349
-You're not doing it.
-No. I can't.

476
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:05,699
No. What you can't do
is break the law

477
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,440
and steal federal property.

478
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,268
Technically,
I break the law all the time.

479
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,271
I just broke into
a supermax prison
two months ago.

480
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,185
Okay.
That is totally different.

481
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,449
That's to serve justice. Right?

482
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,667
Okay. What you're
talking about here

483
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:19,495
is crossing that line
for a friend.

484
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:21,105
How is it different?

485
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,760
She deserves to heal,
and who would it be hurting?

486
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:26,546
You know what?

487
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:28,939
Brainy just illegally hacked
into security cameras

488
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:32,291
at a nightclub to help me solve
this Dr. Jarrod's murder.

489
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:33,988
I don't see you scolding him.

490
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:35,250
Totally different.

491
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,425
But... Yes,

492
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:38,122
Brainy should
not be using DEO tech

493
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,210
to help you write articles.

494
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:40,603
I will crack down on that.

495
00:21:40,647 --> 00:21:42,170
Just want to point out.

496
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:44,607
Who do you think we learned
all this rule-breaking from?

497
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:46,870
That cuts deep.

498
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:56,010
That's Dr. Jarrod,
with William Dey.

499
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:57,620
And what would he
be doing there?

500
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,015
- Hang on.

501
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,582
Let me zoom in.

502
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,888
That's... the spider.

503
00:22:04,932 --> 00:22:06,847
That's the tattoo on his heart.

504
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,330
What do you see?
Do you know that woman?

505
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,896
No. But...

506
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:15,595
I know those tattoos.

507
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,992
So, tell me
what you're going through.

508
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,080
Migraines.

509
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,908
Panic attacks.

510
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:27,258
Well, getting pinned
by snipers in Kandahar

511
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:28,999
is hard on the psyche.

512
00:22:29,043 --> 00:22:30,958
I'm not the same person
I was before.

513
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:33,395
Afghanistan
took something from me.

514
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:37,312
Something in my brain
is broken.

515
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,705
And I want it back.

516
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,665
Can you help me?

517
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:46,016
I have an opening
this Friday,

518
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,497
and we'll start
the intake process.

519
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,543
It can take
a few months to qualify--

520
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:51,805
No!

521
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,068
Oh, I'm so...

522
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,157
Kelly, I can't wait.

523
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,767
I'm in crisis now.

524
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,595
If I don't
get a handle on this...

525
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,032
I'm scared
I'm gonna hurt myself.

526
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:04,557
I am not going to let you
hurt yourself, Pete.

527
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,689
You have to understand...

528
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:07,995
it's not that simple.

529
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:10,650
My job is new,
and then there's protocol...

530
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:12,391
Kelly, please help me.

531
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,835
The office will
thin out in an hour,

532
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:23,576
and I'll sneak you in later.

533
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:25,360
We'll start
with the diagnostic,

534
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,579
and get you some answers.

535
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:27,884
But Pete...

536
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:29,712
we have to keep this
on the down-low.

537
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,410
-Is that okay?
-Oh, of course.

538
00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:34,282
You're a life saver.

539
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,031
Something is bothering you.

540
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,948
No, it's nothing.

541
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:50,994
Your pupil dilation
says otherwise.

542
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:55,129
You can tell me anything.

543
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,917
Brainy, if you had something

544
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:04,268
really important
to tell someone, but...

545
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:08,272
if you did tell them,
it would hurt them very much,

546
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,404
would you still do it?

547
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,234
In my experience...

548
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:15,802
if you care about someone,
you should tell them the truth.

549
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,412
However painful,

550
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,153
both of you
will be better for it.

551
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,677
If you are still feeling blue,

552
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:24,288
I could cheer you up
with a poem.

553
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,162
"An Ode to Nia Nal's
Left Earlobe.

554
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:29,163
-A Villanelle--"
-No!

555
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,774
Please, no.

556
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:38,128
Is there something
you wanted to tell me?

557
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:45,701
No. Um...

558
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,312
But there is something

559
00:24:48,356 --> 00:24:49,357
that I have to tell J'onn.

560
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,796
They aren't tattoos.

561
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,319
This is an Aurafacian.

562
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:58,497
This is an alien organism
that attaches to a host body.

563
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,803
This is the original host.

564
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,326
This Aurafacian
was one of the aliens

565
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,677
that Lex had transferred
out of our desert facility,

566
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,113
and obviously
is still at large.

567
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,115
It can transform back and forth
between a tattoo

568
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:10,030
and a three-dimensional
creature, making her

569
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:12,772
uniquely dangerous
and very hard to stop.

570
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:14,600
Now...

571
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:15,731
Meet our new host.

572
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:21,389
-Can we get an ID?
-Yeah.

573
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,175
And...

574
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,220
Bingo.

575
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,264
Caroline O'Connor.

576
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:29,179
She's former
special ops command,

577
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:32,443
she's highly rated
in hand-to-hand combat,
explosives,

578
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:35,011
and she's a sniper.

579
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,578
She went off the radar
two years ago,

580
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:39,015
and somehow hooked up
with our alien.

581
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:41,017
So somebody
hired her to kill Jarrod.

582
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,932
Yeah. But who? And why?

583
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:45,021
Well, someone went a long way
to cover her tracks.

584
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:47,023
- Not far enough.

585
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:48,677
We just got an address.

586
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:50,418
I'm not gonna let her
hurt anyone else.

587
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:07,043
A flash drive
hidden behind a dresser?

588
00:26:07,261 --> 00:26:08,610
Huh.

589
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,917
I don't think
I invited you here.

590
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:12,745
I invited myself.

591
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,191
Yeah.
I came prepared.

592
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:47,910
James!

593
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,042
Kara!

594
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:55,483
This device uses
magnetic resonance

595
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:57,572
to attract the heavy metals
in their ink.

596
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,442
You ready?

597
00:26:58,486 --> 00:26:59,618
Yeah.

598
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,239
We're examining the evidence
from O'Connor's apartment,

599
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:15,242
including the external drive
you located, Supergirl.

600
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,158
I am simultaneously attempting
to break the encryption on it,

601
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,203
but...
it is far more complicated

602
00:27:20,247 --> 00:27:23,163
than anything I've seen
in the next 1,000 years.

603
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,687
All right.
Let's get these down
into holding.

604
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:27,341
Ew. Ew.

605
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,039
You okay?

606
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:31,388
Yeah.

607
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:34,000
I've been hit harder than that.

608
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,263
You didn't have to do that.

609
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:37,786
With everything you have
on your plate,

610
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,658
your potential
run for Senate...

611
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,138
What if she really hurt you?

612
00:27:42,182 --> 00:27:44,532
When your friend's in trouble,
you jump in, period.

613
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,535
Doesn't matter
the consequences.

614
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:52,540
You keep resting.

615
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:54,455
Tell Alex and Brainy
that I'll be right back.

616
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,849
I'll be on comms
if they get a lead on O'Connor.

617
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:57,806
Okay.

618
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,938
Where you going?

619
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:01,375
To help a friend.

620
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:04,813
It's late, you all right?

621
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:06,119
I need to show you something.

622
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,300
It's the rest of your dream
about what happened on Mars.

623
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,258
The part you didn't see.

624
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,696
Do you want to see it?

625
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:21,047
Because it's going
to be painful.

626
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,398
Absolutely.

627
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,580
H'ronmeer...

628
00:28:33,494 --> 00:28:37,498
I failed you
as I failed my own son.

629
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,675
The agony in my heart...

630
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,157
It's...

631
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,291
Unbearable.

632
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,382
Father, you did the best
you could for Mal.

633
00:28:53,644 --> 00:28:54,907
It's not your fault.

634
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,604
He was my boy.

635
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,172
My child.

636
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:01,914
He could not control
his illness.

637
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,655
The test was mine
and I failed!

638
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,571
I do not deserve to live.

639
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:14,230
And how can I continue
to counsel our people...

640
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:18,452
when I myself am nothing.

641
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,064
Father, our people need you.

642
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,676
I need you.

643
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:30,638
Then I have failed everyone.

644
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,210
H'ronmeer, forgive me.

645
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:01,669
It was me.

646
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:03,758
I'm sorry.

647
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:06,587
I erased him from our minds.

648
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:11,679
I as good as murdered
my own brother.

649
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,637
To save your father.

650
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:15,814
To save us both.

651
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:20,819
I had, uh...

652
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:25,736
I had gone to my father
to seek counsel.

653
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,697
To ease my own pain.

654
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:33,832
And seeing him like that...

655
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,403
Rather than finding
the strength to lift him up,

656
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:41,491
I, uh...

657
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:44,581
I crossed a line

658
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:46,453
that's unforgivable
in my culture.

659
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,763
I spent
the last 300 years...

660
00:30:55,027 --> 00:30:57,159
trying to repent
for having fled Mars...

661
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,380
only to find out

662
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,166
that is the least of my sins.

663
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:08,475
Oh, I am so ashamed.

664
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:10,477
You did it out of compassion.

665
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,695
Out of goodness.

666
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:13,393
Your father was heartbroken.

667
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,570
You saved him.

668
00:31:18,572 --> 00:31:20,182
My father

669
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,881
would rather die than have
his holy mind wiped.

670
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,188
What I did, I did for myself.

671
00:31:29,148 --> 00:31:30,584
You must swear to me...

672
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,414
you will never speak of
what you saw...

673
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,372
to anyone.

674
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:38,592
I swear.

675
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:46,817
These will scan your brain

676
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:48,167
and read your memories.

677
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,387
And your memories
will appear on this screen.

678
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,215
You... You can
see my memories?

679
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,391
Just so I can help you
process them.

680
00:31:55,435 --> 00:31:56,915
Everything's confidential.

681
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:58,960
Okay, but...

682
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:00,266
So, they're just gonna...

683
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:02,224
appear there in real time?

684
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,878
Uh, no, there's a bit of a lag.

685
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,228
It takes a few minutes
for the mapping to finish

686
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:08,143
and the image generators
to do their thing.

687
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:10,580
Don't worry.

688
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:11,451
You'll do great.

689
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,670
Let's do it.

690
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:34,735
Supergirl?

691
00:32:34,778 --> 00:32:36,128
Brainy cracked the encryption
on O'Connor's drive.

692
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,694
Her next target is
Dr. Andrew Stern

693
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,653
at National City Hospital.
We're en route.

694
00:32:39,696 --> 00:32:40,654
I'm on my way.

695
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,269
Supergirl, I got him.
We're in the atrium.

696
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,967
Dr. Stern,
we have reason to believe

697
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,012
that you are the target of
an assassination attempt--

698
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,449
Ah!

699
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,582
-Dr. Stern?

700
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,324
Nice shot.

701
00:33:04,112 --> 00:33:05,766
You're really
starting to bug me.

702
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:26,352
You're him.

703
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,707
My inception power.
It worked.

704
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:46,676
It's Kelly.

705
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,056
Who do you work for?

706
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,318
Who do you work for?

707
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,059
-Alex!

708
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:26,499
She's dead.

709
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:28,631
What just killed her?

710
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,991
Thank you, human.

711
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,297
You have returned my power.

712
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:46,475
What?
What are you doing to me?

713
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,522
This is the power that
the Phantom Zone took from me.

714
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,698
The power
to control your mind.

715
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:54,962
You can thank
your weakness for this.

716
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:58,052
In gratitude,
I'll grant you a quick death.

717
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:01,055
No...

718
00:35:02,187 --> 00:35:03,492
Please.

719
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:08,671
Malefic! No!

720
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,632
No! H'ronmeer's curse.

721
00:35:39,441 --> 00:35:40,442
Freeze.

722
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:42,183
Help.
They're trying to kill me.

723
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:43,619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

724
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,456
There he is. The coffee guy.

725
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,853
No, no, no, wait.
There he is, the janitor.

726
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,030
You can see me?

727
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:11,821
Kelly, look out.

728
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,480
He's gone.

729
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:23,398
What happened?

730
00:36:23,442 --> 00:36:24,834
Malefic came after her.

731
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:27,446
My psychic scan shows
no serious signs of trauma.

732
00:36:27,489 --> 00:36:29,012
But it would seem
the release of Q-waves

733
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,840
somehow interacted
with Obsidian's tech

734
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:34,061
and forged a link between
Kelly's mind and Malefic's.

735
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:36,803
She could see him,
even when he shapeshifted.

736
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:39,197
Well, if she can see him...

737
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,807
Then she's a threat to him.

738
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,635
I'm afraid
it's even worse than that.

739
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,854
My brother now has
the Martian power to incept.

740
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:47,683
Make you do the things
he wants you to do
against your will.

741
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,511
He'll come after her again.

742
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,731
He'll come after all of you.

743
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:53,863
Have you been able
to figure out
why he's doing this?

744
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,955
I put him
in the Phantom Zone

745
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:00,522
for betraying my people.

746
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,524
I guess he just wants revenge.

747
00:37:02,568 --> 00:37:04,265
Look, I'm sorry
that your association with me

748
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:05,614
has put you all in danger.

749
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,008
Malefic is my responsibility.

750
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:08,922
Right now...

751
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,055
we need to get Kelly to safety.

752
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,493
Taking her off the board
is gonna be our best bet.

753
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:16,408
That way I can focus
all of my attention

754
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:19,019
and our DEO resources
on finding him.

755
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:20,325
You want me to go away?

756
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,501
Yes. But just until
we catch him.

757
00:37:22,544 --> 00:37:24,851
I think Alex is right.

758
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:26,896
But don't worry,
I will stay with you. Okay?

759
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,768
No, you've got
decisions to make.

760
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,073
I don't want you missing out.

761
00:37:30,117 --> 00:37:31,771
But you are my priority.

762
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,513
You should leave tonight.

763
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:42,956
How did it go with J'onn?

764
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,001
Good.

765
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,003
Turned out not to be
that big of a deal.

766
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:52,139
I can sense that something
is weighing on you.

767
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:56,099
Well, nothing lifts the spirit
like a villanelle--

768
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:57,013
Stop.

769
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,235
You said I had to be honest
even if it hurts your feelings,

770
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,323
so here's the truth.

771
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:05,805
It's just... too much. Okay?

772
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:08,938
From now on, no more food,
no more poems,

773
00:38:08,982 --> 00:38:10,026
no more anything.

774
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,117
I know...

775
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,902
that you mean well.

776
00:38:15,945 --> 00:38:19,340
I know where
you're coming from,
and it's... sweet.

777
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:22,212
It's all so sweet.
I... I just...

778
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:25,651
It's too much.

779
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:32,788
You... You asked me
to be myself.

780
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:36,139
To be completely
myself with you.

781
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:40,883
But now you tell me
you don't want that.

782
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:46,236
I can only operate at 100%.

783
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,413
That's just how I'm built.

784
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:51,198
Which is entirely my problem...

785
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,027
and not yours.

786
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:01,861
Brainy.

787
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:15,265
I heard about Jarrod.

788
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,399
Yeah.

789
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,314
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this all going.

790
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:22,229
Keep at it.

791
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,362
And good luck.

792
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:43,598
You were right.

793
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:45,905
I was too open
and too trusting.

794
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,255
It's all my fault.

795
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:51,432
I hope they help.

796
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,825
They already have.

797
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:57,133
I hope we haven't crossed
any boundaries?

798
00:39:57,177 --> 00:40:00,267
No, for a friend like you
there are no boundaries.

799
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:08,884
Don't tell me
where you're going, all right?

800
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:09,885
It's going to be better
that way.

801
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:12,105
-Okay.
-Thank you, James.

802
00:40:14,281 --> 00:40:15,282
Hey.

803
00:40:15,543 --> 00:40:16,414
Here.

804
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,546
Take this.

805
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,548
It's one of Lex's
transmatter portal watches.

806
00:40:20,592 --> 00:40:21,897
Don't ask me how I got it.

807
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:25,379
Just... If there's trouble,
just use it.

808
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,467
Thank you.

809
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,077
Everything
is going to be okay.

810
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,123
I'm going to find Malefic
and I'm going
to bring you home.

811
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:35,433
-Bye.
-Drive safe.

812
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,618
You know, you say
everything's going to be fine,

813
00:40:46,661 --> 00:40:49,142
but... I know that face.

814
00:40:49,795 --> 00:40:51,013
You don't believe it.

815
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,538
Look, I love the fact
that she's so open.

816
00:40:53,581 --> 00:40:56,366
It just scares
the life out of me.

817
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,848
Well, maybe...
Maybe it's not so bad,

818
00:40:59,892 --> 00:41:01,241
and it will all work out.

819
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,809
It worked out
with me and Lena.

820
00:41:04,723 --> 00:41:05,985
I hope so.

821
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,074
For the both of us.

822
00:41:12,948 --> 00:41:14,341
Did you find what you need?

823
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:16,952
Take a look.

824
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:18,084
Tell me what you see.

825
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,782
Lex's childhood journals.

826
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:26,571
Hmm. Not seeing schematics
or anything technical.

827
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,486
It's Lex's version
of a Vigenere cipher.

828
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,185
It's a deceptively complex
polyalphabetic substitution.

829
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:36,189
Ah...

830
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:37,843
I see it now.

831
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,715
Deciphering now.

832
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,206
Now I know what I have to do.
