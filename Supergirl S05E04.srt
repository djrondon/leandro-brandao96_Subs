1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,654
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:04,047
It was me.

3
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:06,354
I erased my own brother
from our minds.

4
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:07,877
You lied.

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,270
I think you know more about
the Jarrod story

6
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,836
and for some reason
you don't want me on it.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,837
You asked me

8
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,058
to be completely
myself with you.

9
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,887
I can only operate at 100%.

10
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,758
My brother now has
the power to incept.

11
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:22,848
Make you do the things
he wants you to do
against your will.

12
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,546
The Q-waves somehow

13
00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:26,113
forged a link between
Kelly's mind and Malefic's.

14
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,028
She could see him,
even when he shapeshifted.

15
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,681
We need
to get Kelly to safety.

16
00:00:29,725 --> 00:00:31,205
You should leave tonight.

17
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,510
Take this.

18
00:00:32,554 --> 00:00:34,077
It's one of Lex's
transmatter portal watches.

19
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:35,905
If you need it,
use it.

20
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,060
You cannot run, human.

21
00:01:00,103 --> 00:01:02,453
I'm no human, brother.

22
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,374
What do you know
of hurt?

23
00:01:10,418 --> 00:01:13,290
When the ones you love
turn their back on you,

24
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,336
that's pain.
But you'll see,

25
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,642
when you suffer
the way you made me suffer.

26
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:20,384
You can't touch me
without hurting yourself.

27
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:21,820
That's why he brought me.

28
00:01:25,737 --> 00:01:27,304
We came prepared.

29
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,001
You can't incept
any of us now.

30
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:30,568
Don't be so sure.

31
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,354
Agent Blake?

32
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,012
-J'onn, now.

33
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,429
-Hey, you okay?

34
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:08,345
-Yeah.
-We'll be at
Aunt Vi's in a few.

35
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,522
You know, coming here
after dad died,

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,134
that's what saved me.

37
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:17,049
I don't know what
would've happened

38
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,660
if Aunt Vi
hadn't taken us in.

39
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:19,748
I know.

40
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,160
My God,
what happened to this place?

41
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:45,034
Is that a prison?

42
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:48,559
That's definitely new.

43
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:54,913
Step forward, please.

44
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,396
Eyes straight ahead.

45
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,224
The Martian protocol
is in place.

46
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:03,270
At least Malefic
won't get in here.

47
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,097
Hey, Brainy.

48
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:06,534
What the hell happened?

49
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,362
Malefic should have not
been able to phase through

50
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:09,711
the Phantom Zone projector.

51
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,888
And our psychic inhibitors,
he fried them.

52
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,586
Malefic's brain is unlike
any other Green Martian.

53
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,067
I tried to calibrate both
to his unique physiology, but--

54
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,112
That was our one shot
at tricking him.

55
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,593
He could be after
the real Kelly,
my Kelly right now.

56
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:23,942
We are not
gonna let that happen.

57
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,118
There's gotta be another way
we can track him.

58
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:28,077
Something we're missing.

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,080
What did he yell
at you, J'onn?
Synd'ar'k?

60
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:33,735
Uh, I don't know.

61
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:36,607
It's, um, it's a dialect
I've not heard before.

62
00:03:36,651 --> 00:03:38,740
We can't afford
any more missteps.

63
00:03:38,783 --> 00:03:41,090
I'm having the Verdex Blaster
brought up from the armory.

64
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:44,006
-What?
-Alex.

65
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:46,182
That Verdex Blaster
was designed by Hank Henshaw

66
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,141
to kill Green Martians,
specifically me.

67
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:50,186
It's a last resort.

68
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,188
Hank Henshaw was wrong
about you,

69
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,799
but Malefic is exactly
the kind of Martian

70
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,671
that this blaster
was designed for.

71
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:59,108
Hang on, wait, wait, wait.
Let's not rush into this.

72
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,153
Because if we had had
the Verdex Blaster,

73
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:05,245
Malefic could've incepted
one of us to use it on J'onn.

74
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,551
Let's at least have
Brainy try to fix it first.

75
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:11,033
Okay.

76
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,297
Okay.

77
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:17,996
Excellent. I shall adjust
the Phantom Zone
projector's wavelengths

78
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,868
so Malefic cannot
phase through it

79
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:22,174
while simultaneously
recalibrating the psychic
inhibitor frequencies

80
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:24,307
all to distract myself
from my broken heart.

81
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,309
- Uh, what?
- What?

82
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:28,268
Nothing. Why?

83
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:29,617
What did you hear?

84
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,575
Maybe we should call in Lena
for backup.

85
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:37,059
Nia, what's up?

86
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,756
I was doing some background
on William,

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,933
and guess whose marriage
to a successful lawyer
is a lie? His.

88
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,979
You know that picture of
his wife he keeps on his desk?

89
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:46,938
It's a stock photo
he got off the web.

90
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,636
And that article
Andrea cleared him

91
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,899
to write from London?
Well, I had a weird feeling
about it.

92
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:52,553
So I astral projected
and I followed him,

93
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:54,685
it was like something
out of a James Bond movie.

94
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:57,340
He got passed this newspaper
from some guy,

95
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,690
and now, all of a sudden, he's no longer going to London,

96
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:00,996
he's going to Mexico City.

97
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,041
-Who is this guy?
-Well, let's see,

98
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:06,306
he's a liar who
is literally made of shadows,

99
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,786
and now he's going south
to meet someone named

100
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,179
Elena Torres.

101
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:12,877
I think she might be
his next target.

102
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:13,922
Good work.

103
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,708
-It was Nia?
- Yes.

104
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,450
Yes, she has another
lead on William.

105
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:23,366
Another possible
assassination attempt.

106
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,281
Well, if you think someone's
life is at stake,

107
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,848
-then you should go.
-Are you sure?

108
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,458
-With Kelly?
-I'm sure.

109
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:29,590
Okay.

110
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,506
Wait, before...
Before you go.

111
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,552
Did Nia ask about me?

112
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:37,380
-Oh, God.
-Not that I care.

113
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,557
I mean, not that I don't care,
it's not a big deal.

114
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,993
Uh-huh.

115
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,604
I'll call Lena.

116
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:45,214
Of course, Alex,
I'll be right over.

117
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,566
I believe I've isolated
the problem, Ms. Luthor.

118
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,003
Lex's journals helped us
build the inception tuner

119
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:53,701
to implement thoughts
into the brain,

120
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:56,921
but the specific Q-wave
frequency is incorrect.

121
00:05:56,965 --> 00:06:00,098
Unfortunately, that leaves us
with hundreds of thousands
of variables.

122
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,971
I may have
an expedited solution, Hope.

123
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,929
Alex has just asked me
to assist the DEO

124
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:07,062
in apprehending
a rogue Green Martian.

125
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,280
The brother of J'onn J'onzz?

126
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:09,499
Yes.

127
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,109
Apparently, he has
the ability to override

128
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,894
another person's thoughts
with his own.

129
00:06:12,937 --> 00:06:14,417
Mind control.

130
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:16,419
Using Q-waves.

131
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,856
If we were able
to harness Malefic's abilities,

132
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,945
we could use them
to determine what frequency
is needed

133
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,643
to implant thoughts
into the brain.

134
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,950
The study and testing
would require us
to detain the subject.

135
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:28,649
I doubt Supergirl
or her friends would approve.

136
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,519
No.

137
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,608
I don't think they would.

138
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:47,102
At least
Aunt Vi's house
is the way I remember it.

139
00:06:47,145 --> 00:06:48,451
- Malefic?
-Wait here.

140
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:55,850
Hey.

141
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,860
I saw some kids running
into the woods.

142
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,035
Were they stealing stuff?

143
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,255
I think they were
doing homework.

144
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,063
Why would anyone
want to kill her?

145
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:22,502
She was the lead accountant
for Obsidian Worldwide.

146
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,720
You mean, our parent company?

147
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,287
And William's.

148
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,854
Also, I tracked
that license plate number
you sent me

149
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,421
and got a hit back
courtesy of our friends
at the NCPD.

150
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:33,077
Meet Sergio Ramos,

151
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:35,645
known player
in Intergang, Mexico City.

152
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,779
Are you saying that
William is involved
with organized crime?

153
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,085
This is starting
to get a little
international assassin-y.

154
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,306
We need proof.
We have to find out
what he had on her.

155
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,787
What she had on him.

156
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:51,182
I want to remind you again.

157
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,184
This is liable to be
quite painful.

158
00:08:53,228 --> 00:08:54,795
Until we calibrate
the Phantom Zone projector

159
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,579
to lock onto
a Martian energy signature,

160
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:58,276
regardless of
the Martian's density,

161
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,364
so they can't
phase through it.

162
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,583
I'm ready when you are.

163
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,498
Commencing phasing
at 25%.

164
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,592
Sprock, sprock, sprock.

165
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:11,638
I'm okay. I'm okay.

166
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,248
What went wrong?

167
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,902
It was too much,
too much, too much...

168
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,991
I'm almost done
reinforcing the psychic
inhibitors,

169
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,296
so I can help you,
if you want it.

170
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,081
I heard the scream.
What happened?

171
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,343
-How, how...
-Brainy?

172
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,127
Yeah, I'm...
I'll figure it out, all right?

173
00:09:23,171 --> 00:09:25,129
I'll figure it all out.

174
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:28,785
I'm sorry, J'onn, we need
all of our options
on the table.

175
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:30,482
I'm prepping the blaster.

176
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,575
Alex.

177
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:36,967
Alex, please don't.

178
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,969
I don't...

179
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,276
I don't understand
why you are defending him.

180
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,800
He betrayed you
and all of the Green Martians

181
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:46,498
during the war.
They were slaughtered
because of him.

182
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:48,631
I'm just really sorry
he's doing this.

183
00:09:48,675 --> 00:09:50,720
Well, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

184
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,069
Okay? This isn't your fault.

185
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,942
It's mine.

186
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:56,683
It is killing me
that Kelly is in danger

187
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:59,642
because of me and my job,
and I am terrified

188
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,992
that he is going to use me
somehow to get to her,

189
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,081
and I just keep praying
that she's safe.

190
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,388
I would never let
anything happen to her.

191
00:10:06,431 --> 00:10:09,173
You can't. Promise that.

192
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:11,828
I know that you are trying
to make me feel better, I do.

193
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,003
-But I won't,

194
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,179
not until that monster
is taken care of.

195
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:17,399
You do what you need
to do to feel safe.

196
00:10:19,488 --> 00:10:21,229
But I'm not giving up
on Brainy.

197
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,668
So much around here
has changed.

198
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:28,410
Oh, at least one thing
has changed for the better.

199
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,368
Nelson Stewart?

200
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,414
Isn't that the reporter
you interned for?

201
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:35,417
Nelson taught me
everything I know about
journalistic integrity.

202
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,812
Publisher? Yeah,
way to go, Nelson.

203
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,378
-That's what I'm talking about.

204
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,561
That's it,
I'm calling the cops.

205
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,389
-I'm gonna pay for it.
-Hey, get your hands
off of him.

206
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:53,130
-He was stealing.
-Last time I checked,

207
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,959
it wasn't stealing
when you're still in the store.

208
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,700
And besides, I asked him
to get it for me.

209
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,181
I'm paying for it.

210
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,661
Now give him back
the ravioli.

211
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:09,930
Thanks a lot, lady.

212
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:10,931
I met you, right?
You're one of the kids

213
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:12,236
from before
from the house.

214
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,716
Uh, yeah, so?

215
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,065
So, you have a name?

216
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:16,719
Simon Kirby.

217
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:18,852
It's nice to meet you, Simon.
I'm Kelly.

218
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:21,071
-I'm James.
-I know who you are.

219
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:25,249
I read the news,
CatCo. Guardian. Duh.

220
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:26,729
Uh, here's your food back.

221
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,646
-I'm gonna...
- Yeah.

222
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:34,955
So, my sister's planning
a homemade dinner tonight.

223
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,653
She's an awful cook.

224
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,438
You know, you'd be
doing me a solid

225
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:41,701
if you came by
and ate with us.

226
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,398
I broke into your house,

227
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,182
camped out
in your living room,

228
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,924
and I can make it up to you
by coming over
and eating bad food?

229
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,100
Yeah.
Misery loves company.

230
00:11:51,101 --> 00:11:52,102
So...

231
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:53,495
What do you say?

232
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:22,045
Sorry.
It was open.
Elena Torres?

233
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,569
Don't take this personally.

234
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:36,320
Hey, you really
could've hurt that lady.

235
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,321
Supergirl?

236
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:41,151
I wonder,

237
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:42,718
do you need to breathe?

238
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:01,693
Alex?

239
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:04,522
Agent Sloan,

240
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:05,872
Supergirl's bringing
a prisoner in,

241
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,569
-prep a cell.
-Yes, ma'am.

242
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:15,490
Malefic.

243
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:18,058
You incepted someone
to bypass the Martian protocol.

244
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,365
-Put your gun down.
-You first.

245
00:13:26,196 --> 00:13:28,329
That's better.

246
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:31,811
Now my brother's friend
is his enemy.

247
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,781
I tried grilling her
about William,

248
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,304
but she's not talking.

249
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:48,828
Any news on Malefic?

250
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:49,916
Nothing yet.

251
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,223
You sure you're okay?

252
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,964
I am, yeah, thanks.

253
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:01,449
Now it's time you learned
my brother's crimes.

254
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,895
Pizza will be ready
in a few.

255
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,332
That was so cool,
what you did for me

256
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,377
at the store.

257
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,813
Anyone would've done the same.

258
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,251
No, nobody would've done it.

259
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:23,601
Nobody risks their neck
for anybody around here.

260
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:28,041
But you did.
It was badass and selfless.

261
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,000
Is it supposed to do that?

262
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,223
-You okay?

263
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:37,180
What happened?

264
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,834
Nothing, I just... Headache.

265
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,576
Um, I'm gonna get some air,
will you watch the pizza?

266
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:42,620
Yeah, of course.

267
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,536
Okay.

268
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,624
Oh, it's not that bad.

269
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,799
I like it burned.

270
00:14:47,843 --> 00:14:49,932
Good thing.

271
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,978
So how long you been
living in my aunt's house?

272
00:14:52,021 --> 00:14:53,283
Couple of months.

273
00:14:53,327 --> 00:14:55,329
Sometimes we crash
with friends,

274
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:56,939
sometimes we just camp out
in the woods.

275
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,462
Where are your parents?

276
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,551
Haven't seen my dad
since I was...

277
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,119
five?

278
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,468
My mom got busted
last winter

279
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,470
stealing a space heater
from the hardware store.

280
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:09,865
The judge wouldn't even
give her a chance to explain.

281
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,086
They gave her 10 years
for stealing a 30 buck heater.

282
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:16,132
Since when does petty theft
get you that kind of time?

283
00:15:16,176 --> 00:15:18,961
It's a racket.
The cops, judges, lawyers,

284
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,615
everyone's in on it.

285
00:15:20,658 --> 00:15:21,964
They keep the prison full,

286
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,705
the prison keeps
their pockets lined.

287
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,402
How's nobody
stood up against them?

288
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:26,664
Called these guys out?

289
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,275
Like who?

290
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,973
Nobody's gonna speak up
and risk themselves.

291
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,670
Anyways, you can't beat
the system,

292
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:33,758
so what's the point?

293
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,238
There is a point, Simon.

294
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:37,501
You have to stand up
and fight against injustice.

295
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,242
Everyone's just out
for their own skin.

296
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,244
It's the way it is.

297
00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:43,203
Not on my watch.

298
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,991
Sprock.

299
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,298
I seem to have made the beam
more dense instead of less.

300
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,560
Let's go again.

301
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,431
Just give me
a minute.

302
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:56,607
Okay, J'onn, you can't
keep putting yourself
through this punishment.

303
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,000
- I'm fine.
-No.

304
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,654
You're not,
you can barely stand.

305
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,047
And we need you
at full strength

306
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,918
-for when we find your brother.
-I told you.

307
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,702
I will help Brainy,

308
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,313
so Alex doesn't have
to use the blaster.

309
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:08,663
Go clear your head.

310
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:17,933
Look, Brainy, I know
you haven't asked for help,

311
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,066
-but you're getting it anyway.
-No.

312
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,243
I need my mind consumed
with this problem,
so I don't think of Nia.

313
00:16:23,286 --> 00:16:24,984
What happened
to your little boxes?

314
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:31,077
Little boxes
prevented me from
having a real relationship.

315
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,254
Unfortunately,
my unboxed self

316
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:36,604
does not make a particularly
good boyfriend.

317
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,562
So I have been analyzing
myself for days,

318
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:42,262
searching for a way
to modulate myself
for the woman I love.

319
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,397
Well, I'm not gonna give you
relationship advice.

320
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,705
But as a scientist,
you seem to be stuck

321
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:52,576
in an infinite loop,
and unless you can escape,

322
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,969
you're headed for a crash.

323
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:58,756
-That would be cataclysmic.
-So change a variable.

324
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,758
What's the one thing
you haven't tried yet?

325
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:03,848
Asking for help?

326
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,030
Will you he...

327
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:18,602
Will you help...

328
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,083
me?

329
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,041
Yes.

330
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,134
And I think a small dose
of that will go a long way
with Nia.

331
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:32,138
Okay, could you find me
a polarity tuner,
and we can get to work?

332
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,042
Hey.

333
00:18:08,043 --> 00:18:09,392
Somebody get me
a photographer,

334
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:10,785
we got a celebrity
sighting here.

335
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,265
Nelson, what's up, brother,
how you doing?

336
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,136
-Jimmy Olsen.

337
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,442
What the hell
are you doing here?

338
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,660
I hope you're not
looking for a job,

339
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:17,792
we can't afford you.

340
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:20,011
No, I've actually come
with a story.

341
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,839
So I met this local kid
who says his mom is

342
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:24,320
serving 10 years
for petty theft?

343
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,931
So I did some digging,
and that prison in
your backyard

344
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,978
seems to have a lot of
people serving long sentences
for small crimes.

345
00:18:30,021 --> 00:18:31,980
Yeah, people
have bad luck, I guess.

346
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,112
Bad luck?

347
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:35,810
It's prison corruption,
wouldn't you say?

348
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,944
It's, um,
it's complicated.

349
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,598
Look, I wish
I could help you, but--

350
00:18:41,642 --> 00:18:43,687
You can help me, Nelson,
that's why I'm here.

351
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,428
Journalism's about
fighting for the little guy,

352
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,038
you taught me that.

353
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,344
It's your job to
point out corruption,

354
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,824
so what the hell's
going on here?

355
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,306
Things have changed
for some people.

356
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,179
Idealism doesn't
feed a family.

357
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:59,529
And this whole power
of the press thing,

358
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,880
it might work if you've got
the backing of
a media conglomerate

359
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,839
and a certain girl
with a cape.

360
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:06,319
But around here,
it doesn't mean anything.

361
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:10,149
Standing up for what's right
always means something.

362
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,715
Nelson.

363
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,457
That prison is stomping
on the neck of
this entire town.

364
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:18,244
It's also the only thing
that's keeping this town alive.

365
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:22,161
Look, I'd love to see these
bastards get what they deserve.

366
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,901
But if I call them out,

367
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,034
my advertisers,
they pull their money,

368
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,383
not only am I out of a job

369
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:29,603
but so are the
30 other people I employ.

370
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:32,606
Go back to National City.

371
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,784
I like to think of you there.

372
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:40,135
You know,
I'm just glad somebody
made it out of this town.

373
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,746
And I'm glad it was you.

374
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,798
Listen to this. So my contact
at the Mexico City Herald

375
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:52,713
said the morgue
had a discrepancy.

376
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,976
Elena's body was burned
beyond recognition,

377
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:58,197
but they were able
to use an incisor
to confirm ID and...

378
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,460
it wasn't a match.

379
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,636
Apparently, the body
they pulled from the car

380
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,247
had been dead for two weeks
and died of natural causes.

381
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,640
So they faked Elena's death?

382
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,079
Well, that sheds new light
on my news.

383
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:14,648
I ran the numbers
you found at Elena's apartment
by my accountant friend,

384
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:18,434
and it turns out it's linked
to an offshore bank account.

385
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:19,957
Someone's been funneling
money into it

386
00:20:20,001 --> 00:20:21,959
for the past year,
and there are two names

387
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:24,223
listed on the ledger,
one is Elena's

388
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,441
and the other is anonymous.

389
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:26,355
Huh.

390
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:28,444
You think William?

391
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,532
Maybe.

392
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,883
Embezzlement,
is that what this is?

393
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,277
My friend says there's
an address listed
to the account,

394
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:36,844
but it's encrypted.

395
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,672
Let's call Brainy,
see if he can crack it.

396
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:41,805
Or I could
ask my friend to do it.

397
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:44,286
Are things still weird
between you guys?

398
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,636
He did seem a little off
this morning.

399
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,117
I was afraid
this would happen.

400
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,815
I thought that if I was just
honest with Brainy,

401
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,208
it would help solve
our problems,

402
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,254
but it's only
made things worse.

403
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,430
I know it's something that
we could work through together,

404
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,649
but he thinks that
it's his problem to solve,

405
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,303
and now he won't
even talk to me.

406
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,044
Well, you know how Brainy is,

407
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:06,134
sometimes human emotions
just throw him for a loop.

408
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:08,832
I think he just needs time,

409
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:11,661
and to realize
you're not going anywhere.

410
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,490
Okay.
So you get this back

411
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,666
to your friend,
see if she can unencrypt it.

412
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,581
I'm gonna get to the DEO.

413
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,322
Talk to Alex and J'onn,
see if there's any news

414
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:21,323
on the Malefic front.

415
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:22,759
Copy that, boss.

416
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:24,935
We are so close
to cracking this,
I can feel it.

417
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,080
On a clear day, you can see
the moons of Mars from here.

418
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,777
Today's not a clear day.

419
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,518
I found out
what you've done, J'onn.

420
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:43,954
You lied to all of us.

421
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,608
You put us in jeopardy,

422
00:21:45,652 --> 00:21:47,915
so that you could
protect yourself.

423
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,525
Keep your secret safe.

424
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,442
That you mind-wiped
the existence

425
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,923
-of your own brother--
-Alex, I wanted to tell you,

426
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,055
but I was so ashamed.

427
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:03,365
I confided in you
how this was tearing me apart.

428
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,715
How I thought that
I was the one

429
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,023
putting Kelly in danger,
and you just stood there,

430
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,504
knowing that
it wasn't my fault.

431
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:13,680
That it was yours.

432
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:17,466
You had me convinced
that Malefic was the monster,

433
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,731
but he wasn't just some
bad guy coming after people.

434
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,865
He was some bad guy
that you created

435
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:27,520
coming after your family,
and again

436
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,739
you just stood there,

437
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:33,308
and you let us suffer
the consequences.

438
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,619
-I know.
-You may say

439
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:43,231
that you erased Malefic
to protect your family,

440
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,712
to protect Myr'nn.

441
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:49,759
Or you did it
because it was easier

442
00:22:49,803 --> 00:22:51,326
-than helping him.
-No.

443
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,763
No, no.

444
00:22:53,807 --> 00:22:56,418
Malefic isn't
the monster here, J'onn.

445
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,944
-You are.

446
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,687
Alex.

447
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,821
Alex.

448
00:23:13,087 --> 00:23:14,567
Yeah, okay, thanks.

449
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,004
-Hey, so...

450
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:18,309
The newspaper
might've been a bust,

451
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:21,443
but good news, the best lawyer
in National City

452
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,966
has decided
to take your mom's case.

453
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,011
For real?

454
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:25,795
Yeah, I wouldn't kid
about that.

455
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,015
And don't worry
about her fee.

456
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,451
-I'll cover it.
- Wow.

457
00:23:30,147 --> 00:23:31,758
When do we meet her?

458
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,673
I could probably set up
a meeting with you guys
next week.

459
00:23:33,716 --> 00:23:35,109
You mean, you won't be there?

460
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:36,763
Oh, no, no, I...

461
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:39,505
This was a visit, Simon,
I can't stay here.

462
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,291
Right.

463
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:47,600
Of course,
why would you?

464
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:49,123
This town is a hellhole.

465
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:50,907
Hey, no, no,
it's not like that.

466
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,213
It's cool.

467
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:53,823
I get it.

468
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,651
It's not your problem.

469
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:58,654
Thanks for the help
and the food.

470
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,396
-See you around.
- Hey.

471
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,137
Simon.

472
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:13,713
J'onn?

473
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,150
What is it?

474
00:24:17,194 --> 00:24:18,544
Is it something
about Malefic?

475
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,111
Synd'ar'k.

476
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,379
A synd'ar'kis a sinner,
that's what Malefic
yelled at me.

477
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:31,034
I asked Nia to use
her dream power

478
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:33,602
to help me find
the truth about my brother,

479
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,735
about the mind wipe.

480
00:24:35,778 --> 00:24:37,432
That's when we discovered...

481
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,484
My brother wasn't born evil.

482
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:48,356
He had a problem.

483
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,401
And we...

484
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:53,056
ostracized him.

485
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,277
I wiped Malefic's existence
from our minds.

486
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:57,757
It was me.

487
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:02,457
I did this.

488
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,636
I failed my people
more than once.

489
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,855
I'm failing you.

490
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:11,858
No, no, you've saved us
countless times.

491
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:13,642
I would've been dead
last year,

492
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:16,079
when the Earth was seeded
with Kryptonite,
if it weren't for you.

493
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,341
Still...

494
00:25:18,908 --> 00:25:20,475
Wiping him
from our mind?

495
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,566
It's like I murdered
my own brother.

496
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:26,263
But you remember now.

497
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,703
You risked your own life

498
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,575
to find those memories,
and now you can find him

499
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:34,881
and make different choices.

500
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:43,672
It was so selfish of me to...

501
00:25:43,716 --> 00:25:45,979
burden Nia
with my secret,

502
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,547
and keep this
from you and Alex.

503
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:54,117
But I'm glad Nia told her.

504
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,293
She deserves to know
the truth, and so do you.

505
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:58,252
It couldn't have been Nia,
she's been with me.

506
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,039
That was Malefic.

507
00:26:05,172 --> 00:26:06,869
He incepted Alex.

508
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,221
I can't find Alex anywhere.

509
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:14,442
She turned off
her phone and her comms.

510
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:17,314
Where are we with
the Phantom Zone projector
and psychic inhibitors?

511
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:18,620
Reconfigured and recalibrated.

512
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,970
Supergirl, the Verdex Blaster
is missing

513
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,320
and the armory's cleared out
of anti-Martian artillery.

514
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:25,366
-It's all gone.
-We have to find Alex now.

515
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,847
There is a way.

516
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,631
I could try
and find her psychically.

517
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,764
Malefic's mind is poisonous
to all Green Martians.

518
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:33,635
Melding with Alex's
incepted mind

519
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,332
would allow Malefic
into yours.

520
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:37,334
It could hurt you.

521
00:26:37,378 --> 00:26:39,032
All that matters
is finding Alex.

522
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,473
Alex.

523
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,214
Open your mind for me.

524
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:49,956
We are looking for you.

525
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,523
We need you to come home.

526
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:55,701
Please, Alex, answer me.

527
00:27:07,582 --> 00:27:08,888
You did what
you could for him, James.

528
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,541
It wasn't enough.

529
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:13,588
I mean, when Simon says

530
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,417
it's not my problem,
maybe it should be.

531
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,898
I mean,
this kid's got nobody.

532
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,729
Hey, you okay?

533
00:27:27,254 --> 00:27:29,560
I'm having...

534
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,649
visions.

535
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,389
I thought they were
in my head,

536
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:34,261
but whatever happened
at Obsidian,

537
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,480
it didn't just allow me
to see Malefic.

538
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,570
I think I'm connected
to him.

539
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:42,225
I think I can see
what he sees.

540
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,751
And he has Alex. We need to
go back to National City now.

541
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:47,187
We're not going back
to National City.

542
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,189
We came here
to get you away from Malefic.

543
00:27:49,232 --> 00:27:51,365
James, when you put on
that Guardian suit,

544
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:53,019
do you think first?

545
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:56,413
Or do you see someone
in trouble and act?

546
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:58,154
-That's different.
-The hell it is.

547
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,765
We're going back now.

548
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:05,466
Damn it, Malefic,
where is she?

549
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:12,908
J'onn.

550
00:28:12,952 --> 00:28:15,258
Meet me
at the planetarium.

551
00:28:16,564 --> 00:28:17,957
Come alone.

552
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:24,050
Welcome to Mars,

553
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:27,053
home to one of the greatest civilizations.

554
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:30,839
Wiped out by
the Great Martian civil war.

555
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:33,842
One Green Martian now
lives on Earth among us.

556
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:36,715
The Martian Manhunter.

557
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:41,763
A coward who left his family
to face an agonizing death
and worse.

558
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:43,809
And he's come here
to pay for it.

559
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,293
Alex, please.

560
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,252
Alex.

561
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:53,993
I know my brother's
making you do this.

562
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,212
And if you can hear me,
so can he.

563
00:29:00,564 --> 00:29:02,349
I never should have
banished you.

564
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:05,221
I know that now.

565
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,006
I've lived on Earth
for over 300 years.

566
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:11,837
But I never really found
true peace.

567
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,622
And I believe it's because
of what I did to you, Malefic.

568
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,236
You didn't betray us.

569
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,847
By aligning with
the White Martians,

570
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,457
we betrayed you.

571
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,893
We tried to fix you.

572
00:29:24,937 --> 00:29:26,155
Change you.

573
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,375
When all along,
we should've accepted you.

574
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,596
I accept you now, brother.

575
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,076
-No!
-Yes.

576
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,078
You forced me
to look inside myself

577
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:39,516
and discover memories
I had erased.

578
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:44,086
You did it
to try and punish me.

579
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:47,786
But...

580
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:53,182
Don't you see you've given us
a second chance?

581
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,403
It's not too late
for us, brother.

582
00:29:59,145 --> 00:30:00,537
It's not...

583
00:30:00,581 --> 00:30:01,712
too...

584
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,847
-late.

585
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,025
-Oh, my God.

586
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,071
What have I done?

587
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:16,597
No!

588
00:30:19,774 --> 00:30:23,386
On Mars, you had nothing
but cruelty for me.

589
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,606
Where did this love
and forgiveness come from?

590
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:26,694
From my family.

591
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,565
Family's supposed
to destroy you.

592
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,567
He was supposed
to come alone too.

593
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:34,615
This ends now, Malefic.

594
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:36,312
Tell that to my friends.

595
00:30:37,748 --> 00:30:38,880
They've been incepted.

596
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,186
The shield matrix, J'onn.

597
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,413
Yeah, this dome won't last
with all the firepower.

598
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:53,808
What is that?

599
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,379
We are not going
to lose you again.

600
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:03,470
The roof.

601
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:06,081
If it collapses, then everyone
in here is gonna die.

602
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,649
Go. Kara, go.

603
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:18,964
J'onn, you gotta
get me out of this thing.

604
00:31:21,053 --> 00:31:22,445
Kelly, you shouldn't
be here.

605
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:23,925
This is exactly
where I should be here.

606
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,448
-What the hell is that thing?
-Oh, my God.

607
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:27,581
A bomb. A hybrid of Tamaranean
and Pharoid technology.

608
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,452
It's synched
to Alex's molecular structure.

609
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,238
Supergirl,
can you hear me?

610
00:31:32,281 --> 00:31:33,326
Yeah.

611
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,632
When the dome fails,
you and Guardian

612
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,243
gather all of
the stolen weapons.

613
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:40,333
Kelly, you're the only one
who can see him,
so find Malefic.

614
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:54,956
-J'onn.
-Do you trust me?

615
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,826
Yes.

616
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,135
Supergirl, now.

617
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,707
It's Malefic
in the blue jacket.

618
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,899
So Malefic's
back in the Phantom Zone?

619
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,469
I'm sorry that
you couldn't save him.

620
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:32,124
J'onn, I know that that's
what you wanted to do.

621
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,996
But I heard everything
that you said to him.

622
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:38,739
I just wish
he could've taken it in.

623
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:43,091
But maybe now
that I remember,

624
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:45,528
I have a chance to make
things right at some point.

625
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:51,317
How could you ever think
that I would say those things

626
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,362
or think those things
about you?

627
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:57,236
I guess because I thought
those things about myself.

628
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,890
Well, I remember you
telling me once that

629
00:32:59,934 --> 00:33:02,719
true character reveals itself
in times of hardship.

630
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:05,244
And I know who you really are.

631
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:17,734
We couldn't have
done it without you.

632
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,736
Please, I barely
did anything.

633
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,435
What? You fixed
the inhibitors
and the projector.

634
00:33:22,478 --> 00:33:24,263
It did feel good.

635
00:33:24,306 --> 00:33:26,047
You and me working
together as a team.

636
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:28,571
-Now that I know
who you actually are.

637
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:33,054
Well, get used to it,
because you are now
officially a Superfriend.

638
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,144
We have T-shirts
and a handshake.

639
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,841
-I'll teach it to you.
It's not a big deal.

640
00:33:37,885 --> 00:33:39,452
It's a whole thing.

641
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,976
We're going out to get drinks
tonight, do you wanna come?

642
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,500
Oh, I would love to,
but I have been here all day,

643
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:45,849
so I really should
get back to L-Corp.

644
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:49,244
Of course. No rest
for the world-saving genius.

645
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,475
Since Malefic is gone,

646
00:34:02,518 --> 00:34:06,522
how about less fighting
on the frontlines
and more...

647
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,437
cuddles and Netflix?

648
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,960
Okay, yeah, I'm in.

649
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:14,095
Please, take this as a token
of my deepest apologies.

650
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,750
Brainy, this is perfect.

651
00:34:16,793 --> 00:34:22,930
I do not know when or how
I will find a way to be myself,

652
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:26,238
and yet not succumb
to my more obsessive qualities.

653
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,109
Perhaps we could
work on it together?

654
00:34:28,936 --> 00:34:30,242
I'm not going anywhere.

655
00:34:32,635 --> 00:34:33,462
Dibs.

656
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:34,550
Did you just say "dibs"?

657
00:34:34,594 --> 00:34:36,117
- I did.
- Well done.

658
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,902
Okay, here is
to always being together.

659
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,817
Cheers.

660
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,864
About that.

661
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:46,823
You guys all know that
I've been doing
a lot of soul searching

662
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:48,303
since I left CatCo.

663
00:34:48,347 --> 00:34:49,913
Trying to figure out
what's next.

664
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:52,829
I knew I wanted to give back,
and I wanted to help people.

665
00:34:54,701 --> 00:34:57,573
But I was driving myself
crazy trying to figure out

666
00:34:57,617 --> 00:35:00,794
where to put those efforts.

667
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:06,582
And then my extremely
wise sister...

668
00:35:08,018 --> 00:35:10,195
...gave me some
damn good advice.

669
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:12,545
She said, "Stop trying
so hard to figure things out,

670
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,374
and just be still

671
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:17,898
and listen."

672
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:19,204
And finally I heard it.

673
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:22,032
Only it wasn't a voice
from inside of me,

674
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,164
it was this kid's voice,

675
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,645
this kid that we met
in Calvintown.

676
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:28,822
Sadly, it's become
this cesspool
for crime and corruption.

677
00:35:29,431 --> 00:35:30,911
And he told me that

678
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:33,566
no one's there
willing to help.

679
00:35:33,609 --> 00:35:37,222
There's nobody willing
to stand up and
do the right thing.

680
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:40,181
There's nobody willing
to put their neck on the line.

681
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:42,183
And just like that,

682
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:44,098
that's what I knew
I had to do.

683
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,795
Look, I've been fighting
the good fight

684
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,103
from a fancy corner office
for years.

685
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,671
And in the streets
of National City as Guardian.

686
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,414
But I started off
as a guy with a camera.

687
00:35:57,894 --> 00:35:59,940
A camera our dad gave me.

688
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:05,424
Among the people.

689
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,776
And that is
where I need to be.

690
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,778
For now,

691
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,607
I'm going back to Calvintown.

692
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:17,566
-I'm going home.

693
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,742
And I'm gonna show that town
that there is somebody

694
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,179
who is willing
to fight for them.

695
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,009
I'm gonna buy
the Calvintown Gazette.

696
00:36:26,053 --> 00:36:27,185
Wow.

697
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,405
Look, Andrea Rojas
may be able to stop me

698
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:31,711
from writing
for a newspaper,

699
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,495
but she can't stop me
from publishing one.

700
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:35,932
That's amazing.

701
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,108
And what are
we gonna do without you?

702
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,633
One of the main reasons
I moved to National City

703
00:36:40,676 --> 00:36:43,070
was because Clark wanted me
to keep an eye on you.

704
00:36:45,072 --> 00:36:46,682
But you're the one
that kept an eye on me.

705
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:49,555
You never needed me.

706
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:53,254
Not then,
and certainly not now.

707
00:36:54,473 --> 00:36:56,910
Yeah, but we are going
to miss you.

708
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,781
So much.

709
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,831
My feelings are springing out,

710
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:07,268
and I can't seem to find
a little box to contain them.

711
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:08,617
Okay, try this box.

712
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:12,012
To James.

713
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:16,059
To James.

714
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,191
No.

715
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,801
To you guys.

716
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,895
I can't believe James
is really gone.

717
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:27,549
I guess part of me
always thought he'd come back.

718
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,290
I know.

719
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:31,814
But I'm happy for him.
He deserves this.

720
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:32,902
Yeah.

721
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,298
Kara?

722
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:41,781
What is it?

723
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:44,523
My friend unencrypted
the address associated
with Elena's account.

724
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,133
It's here.

725
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,266
In National City.

726
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:02,323
What?

727
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,031
How the hell
did you get in here?

728
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,340
-What is this?
-Kara, walk out of here,

729
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,472
forget what you just saw.

730
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:21,603
-It's too dangerous.
-What are you?

731
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:23,823
-An undercover cop?
-I'm a journalist,

732
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:25,085
like you.

733
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,695
I work for
The Timesin London,

734
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:30,177
I'm here undercover
to investigate Andrea Rojas.

735
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,918
I'm sorry,
but you've got to leave.

736
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:33,223
Before you get
mixed up in this.

737
00:38:33,267 --> 00:38:36,836
Be real with me this once,
and maybe I will.

738
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:39,055
'Cause I already know about
your offshore bank account,

739
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,361
the one you share
with Elena Torres.

740
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,363
I know you were
in Mexico City yesterday,

741
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,886
helping her fake
her own death.

742
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,975
I know that you pretend
to have a wife, but you don't.

743
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:49,239
I know about Dr. Jarrod,
Dr. Stern,

744
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:51,546
so why don't you stop
trying to cover your tracks

745
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,982
and just try
telling the truth?

746
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,596
Elena thought
they were onto her,

747
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,380
that they knew she was
talking to someone,

748
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,816
I needed to keep her safe.

749
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:03,384
And what about your
Intergang friend Sergio Ramos?

750
00:39:03,428 --> 00:39:05,647
Sergio is Interpol,
undercover.

751
00:39:05,691 --> 00:39:07,214
He helped me get her out.

752
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:10,260
If the Rojases are dirty,
why aren't you saying anything?

753
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:12,132
Because I haven't found
the proof yet.

754
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,177
Two years' worth of reporting

755
00:39:14,221 --> 00:39:17,050
that suggests
a criminal conspiracy
bigger than Al Capone,

756
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:19,139
but nothing that connects
the Rojases directly.

757
00:39:19,182 --> 00:39:22,185
It's why I took the job
at CatCo, to get close
to Andrea.

758
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:24,797
Doing everything I can to get
into the Rojas inner circle.

759
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,929
You have been a toxic jerk
since you got here.

760
00:39:26,973 --> 00:39:28,496
How do I know
you're not just spinning this

761
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,368
to get me off the scent
of what you're actually up to?

762
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,112
Because that jerk
was a lie.

763
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:38,506
An identity I put on
to keep everyone at CatCo

764
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,681
from wanting to
get
to know me.

765
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:41,770
-Well, it worked.
-And it killed me.

766
00:39:41,814 --> 00:39:43,772
Every time I was rude to you,

767
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:46,645
every time I lied about what
I've really been up to.

768
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:49,430
Now that you know,

769
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,432
at least I can
be honest with you.

770
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,695
At least maybe
you can forgive me.

771
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,134
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

772
00:39:58,178 --> 00:39:59,745
I don't blame you.

773
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,225
I'd hate me too.

774
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,792
Giving you
the cold shoulder.

775
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:07,187
Being hypercompetitive
in order to get closer
to Andrea.

776
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,232
Criticizing your writing,

777
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,931
instead of telling you
what I really thought.

778
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:15,413
You mean my work's
not really "sentimental tripe"?

779
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,722
Your articles are honest
and smart.

780
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,333
I could never write
the way you write.

781
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,465
You have two Pulitzers.

782
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,249
It's not from
the writing.

783
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:28,121
It's from the story.

784
00:40:28,164 --> 00:40:31,951
I have craft,
you have art.

785
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:36,869
Now promise me
you'll let this go.

786
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,914
I'd never forgive myself
if you got wrapped up in this.

787
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:42,178
You don't have
to worry about me.

788
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:44,485
I can take care of myself.

789
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:48,489
I don't doubt that
you can take care of everything
you set your mind to.

790
00:40:53,102 --> 00:40:54,539
Wow.

791
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,366
Can't believe
you came back.

792
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,759
That you bought the paper.

793
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:00,980
What can I say?

794
00:41:01,023 --> 00:41:03,504
I like a challenge.

795
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,854
Who knows, maybe you and I
could fix this town together.

796
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,684
By the way,

797
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,164
you know how
to work a camera?

798
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:13,558
Like, on my phone?

799
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,038
No,
not like on your phone.

800
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,301
Like a real one.

801
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:22,392
My dad gave me
this camera.

802
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:26,309
And now it's yours.

803
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:30,183
Thanks, Chief.

804
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,314
Don't call me chief.

805
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:34,404
It's Jimmy.

806
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:39,366
Where am I?

807
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:42,151
This is not the Phantom Zone.

808
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:44,589
By now you've realized
you can't phase through
these walls.

809
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:47,679
But don't think of this
as a prison.

810
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:48,854
I'm not your enemy.

811
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,074
In fact, I think
we can help each other.
