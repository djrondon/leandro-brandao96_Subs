1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:02,915
Previously onSupergirl...

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:06,484
I helped Lex bring you back
for the sake of the future.

3
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:10,140
Another Brainiac told me
that it was absolutely critical

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:13,056
that I help Lex
in complete secrecy.

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,406
Yes, it may be too late
for you, Father,

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,930
but soon I will accomplish
what you could not.

7
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,454
I will live forever.

8
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,240
Forty-two!

9
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:25,938
What? They don't have these
in the 30th century.

10
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:27,897
I can get Al
to make you up a bunch

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,464
and you can take 'em with you
if you like.

12
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,770
Or you can just keep eating
until the kitchen runs out.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,425
Then you'd be able to stay
for one more song.

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,253
Once the Legion ship has power,
I gotta go.

15
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:39,256
Speaking of which,
you never told us
what your Legion call sign is.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,605
-I didn't?
-No.

17
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,303
It's not a big deal.

18
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,521
Are you kidding?

19
00:00:43,565 --> 00:00:44,914
Uh, according to Brainy,

20
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:47,090
before every Legion member
puts on his vestments,

21
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,179
he must have a call sign.

22
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:50,746
"Computer Lad."

23
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,704
-Huh.

24
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,967
-What?
-You know, it's a hop,
skip, and a jump

25
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,665
from Cat Grant's IT guy.

26
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:59,102
-Wow.
-Why is "Computer Lad"
your name?

27
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:02,018
It's not "Martian Manhunter"
or whatever, sure,

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,455
but Legionnaires' names speak
to who they are, right?

29
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:07,023
So, Chemical King has power
for chemicals,

30
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,764
Lightning Lass controls
electricity.

31
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,983
One day,
my brother-in-law decides
to call me "Computer Lad,"

32
00:01:11,027 --> 00:01:12,115
and it kind of stuck.

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,856
And, I don't know,
I kind of like it.

34
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,118
- Okay.
-It's nice.

35
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,467
-Kara.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,817
You invited William.

37
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,428
It... It's nothing.

38
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,082
After game night,
I couldn't not.

39
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,996
Karaoke's all night,
so come on up, guys.

40
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,433
-Hey.
-Hi.

41
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:27,478
Kara, you didn't tell me
it was karaoke night.

42
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,524
Is karaoke your thing?

43
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:33,005
Clearly, you've never heard
my rendition of "Africa"
by Toto.

44
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,097
Oh! Kara has been threatening
to do that one for a long time.

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,099
-I haven't.
-So, we're gonna
do it together?

I heard about Lex sneaking
past the government security

63
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,285
to probe the Legion ship.

64
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,069
He must be driving you crazy.

65
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:40,551
I mean, not even Winn
could find anything unturned
on the ship.

66
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,727
I know that
he is up to something.

67
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:47,079
Which is why
I uploaded some spyware
onto my DEO intranet.

68
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:49,995
That way, whatever he does,
I will see.

69
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,302
Alex, I'm proud of you
for staying to fight
the good fight,

70
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:54,217
but I do worry.

71
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,610
Well, you don't have to

72
00:02:55,653 --> 00:02:57,612
because I can handle myself.

73
00:02:57,655 --> 00:03:00,310
And, plus,
Brainy's got my back.

74
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:04,271
Mr. Luthor.

75
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,925
I uploaded you the file
on Gemma Cooper.

76
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:10,451
Excellent. Now you're free
to help with
the Alex Danvers problem.

77
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:11,365
Problem?

78
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:12,540
She's been spying on me.

79
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,237
She hasn't interfered
with our work,

80
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,065
but if she does,

81
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:19,024
it might require
more permanent actions.

82
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,591
Help her control herself.

83
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,332
Now, is everything
quiet there?

84
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,334
Of course.

85
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,424
No disruptions
or technical difficulties?

86
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:29,121
No.

87
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:30,079
Good.

88
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:31,776
Keep me posted.

89
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,154
I'm on my way.

90
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,634
911 at the DEO.

91
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,897
-I'll track it.
-Oh. I... I'll join you.

92
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:07,203
I thought you were leaving.

93
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,813
You guys bailed me out.

94
00:04:08,857 --> 00:04:10,859
No, I'm not leaving
this century
without repaying you.

95
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,860
What don't you do well?

96
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:13,209
Are you kidding me?

97
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,211
With those harmonies?
Where did that come from?

98
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,169
With a partner like you,
it's easy.

99
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,737
Would you, uh...

100
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,391
Would you like to
go out sometime?

101
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,871
Just us.

102
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,046
Like a date?

103
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:25,177
A date.

104
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,091
What do you think?

105
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:27,658
Hey, Super--

106
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:28,659
-Kara.
-Mmm-hmm.

107
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:29,660
She is super.

108
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:30,966
-Sure.
-Um,

109
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,448
Alex needs you at...
your grandmother's house.

110
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,494
You know, your D... ear...

111
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,888
Old Gran Gran's house,
like, immediately.

112
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,846
Is everything all right?

113
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,152
Yeah. She's just been feeling
under the weather.

114
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,196
I should really go.

115
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,328
-Yeah.
-I'm so sorry.

116
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,242
Yeah.

117
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:13,269
How is that coming
through our comms?

118
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,272
I used to listen to this song
in the shop when I was a kid...

119
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,709
with my dad.

120
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,537
Okay, wait, so you're saying...

121
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:22,496
I think Toyman's back.

122
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,551
What do you mean,
not a bug from Toyman?

123
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,726
What else could it be?

124
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,206
Initially, I thought
the drone outburst

125
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,034
was just some bad code
in our surveillance software,

126
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,122
but this,

127
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:41,732
this is in our whole system.

128
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,386
So, it's a virus?

129
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,693
More like
artificial intelligence.

130
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,477
Whoa, that's why
he was playing the song.

131
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,174
This is my dad.

132
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:52,221
The last thing that
he was working on was
a version of this.

133
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:54,919
A way to put his whole mind
into the digital space.

134
00:05:54,963 --> 00:05:57,618
He... He wanted to
become hyper conscious.

135
00:05:57,661 --> 00:06:00,272
If he could become immortal
in the World Wide Web,

136
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,753
he would be the ultimate player
in the ultimate playground.

137
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,277
Once there, he could commit
any act of violence.

138
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:09,630
Any time, any place,
air traffic, hospitals,
US Nuclear Command.

139
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:12,110
But you said your dad
was still working on it, so--

140
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:14,112
And, plus,
this Toyman isn't him,

141
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,680
okay, so how could he
be doing what your father
was trying to do?

142
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:20,380
Lenses. This Toyman has
the Obsidian Platinum lenses.

143
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:24,296
Storage vault.
Bring up item 906016.

144
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,865
I noted something
on this video of our
final meeting with Toyman.

145
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,997
There.

146
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,433
See, Toyman uses
the Obsidian lenses

147
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,130
to download himself
onto a laptop.

148
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:34,698
Didn't we confiscate a laptop
and bring it back here?

149
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,707
The hardware's clean
but there's
a compartmentalized drive.

150
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,622
That would make it appear
to be off while still working.

151
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:47,450
Toyman found a way
to leap into our Internet

152
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,670
and bypass the DEO's firewall
to the outside.

153
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:52,455
-Okay, so do we have
a fix for this?

154
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,152
Yeah. My dad's code.

155
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:56,807
I think I can
reverse-engineer it
into a kill code.

156
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,026
- Lockdown.

157
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,070
Lockdown.

158
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,855
Lockdown.

159
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:02,117
-Lockdown.

160
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,248
Lockdown.

161
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,427
Don't you guys know it's rude
to talk about someone
behind their back?

162
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,558
Toyman?

163
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,168
Okay, tell me
this is a video, guys.

164
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,910
Oh, no, I am everything
I used to be,

165
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,391
but electronic and immortal.

166
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,655
Now, lower the DEO's firewall
to the World Wide Web

167
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:22,354
or I will use
all of your toys to kill you.

168
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,453
He's taking control
of our laser defenses.

169
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:56,606
Did you kill it?

170
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,390
No. I just knocked him
out of the command center.

171
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,653
So he can come back?

172
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,829
Oh, he can, and will.

173
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,836
Okay.

174
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,360
I want us to round up
every item this thing
can use against us,

175
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,057
guns, comm links,

176
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,973
anything with a Bluetooth
that can connect
to our intranet,

177
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,540
and I want it evacuated.

178
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,890
As long as
there's technology here
this AI can access,

179
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,065
we are sitting ducks.

180
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:21,936
Go.

181
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,592
I'll gather gear too.

182
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:28,159
Once we've got everything,
I can fly it outside
of Toyman's signal range.

183
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:29,073
Okay.

184
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:31,859
Brainy, can you isolate the AI?

185
00:08:31,902 --> 00:08:33,121
I pushed him down
from the command center

186
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,949
to the server level
under a virtual lid.

187
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,690
-But he's still fighting
to get back up here.

188
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,908
Look.

189
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,736
Well, what if he breaks
through the lid?

190
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,261
There is a 92.6% chance
he'll make his way
onto the World Wide Web.

191
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:46,047
When he's there,
he can attack... everything.

192
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,440
Okay, well, what if Supergirl
goes down to the server level

193
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,007
and fries everything?

194
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:52,009
The servers are located
on top of the DEO's power core.

195
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,794
If they melt,
so does the core.

196
00:08:53,837 --> 00:08:56,231
It would vaporize all life
within a three-mile radius.

197
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,281
Do you hear that?

198
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:04,587
Is that
an old-fashioned telephone?

199
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:11,768
Um...

200
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:13,683
Okay.

201
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,167
Director Danvers, why is
my DEO on lockdown tonight?

202
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,472
It's Toyman, sir.

203
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,386
Toyman?

204
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,171
I thought he was dead.

205
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,434
Yes, well, apparently,
he has uploaded himself
into our system.

206
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:27,523
It took us all
completely by surprise.

207
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,611
Clearly.

208
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:30,352
Can you sequester the AI?

209
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:33,137
The last thing
this world needs is
a rogue Toyman on the Web.

210
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,225
We're trying.

211
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:36,140
And in the meantime,
just in case,

212
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:37,577
I'm gathering
all of our smart tech

213
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,927
to have Supergirl
fly it out immediately.

214
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,102
I know it's a risk,

215
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:42,451
but if anyone can
do the job, it's her.

216
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,496
But she can't.

217
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,848
In case you've forgotten,
rogue Kryptonians have
attacked our planet before.

218
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:50,067
The DEO has
Kryptonite safeguards in place,

219
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,156
and, no,
they cannot be disabled.

220
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,420
Well, we have anti-Kryptonite
technology to protect her.

221
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,684
I think you're remembering that
from another time.

222
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,163
Another Earth, perhaps.

223
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,339
I have a split shift crew.

224
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:04,168
You want the 12 of us
to go around the entire DEO

225
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,996
to dismantle all of our tech

226
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,304
and hope that Toyman
doesn't regain control
while we do it?

227
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:12,133
National safety is
our primary responsibility,

228
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,439
and that is why you have to do
everything in your power

229
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,746
to neutralize that thing
and not let it get out.

230
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,878
Are we understood?

231
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:19,096
Yes, sir.

232
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,837
Good. Keep me posted.

233
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:26,626
Winn.

234
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:41,945
Agent Dox. I was wondering
when you'd call.

235
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,513
You knew Toyman would
upload himself into the DEO.

236
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:46,428
I correctly theorized it, yes.

237
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,516
And you didn't tell me.

238
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,604
It was need-to-know.

239
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,127
And now that you do know,

240
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,564
you need to know,
I want you to get me
Toyman's code.

241
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:54,654
What Toyman used
to put himself
into the computer.

242
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,960
Why?

243
00:10:57,004 --> 00:10:58,832
So we can beat Leviathan
at their own game.

244
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,921
They are the greatest threat
this planet faces.

245
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:03,837
And you want their immortality.

246
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,274
It's the one advantage
they have over me.

247
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,363
With this code, I can
level the playing field.

248
00:11:08,406 --> 00:11:10,452
As soon as you can make sure
no one is watching,

249
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:12,715
access Toyman's code
and copy it.

250
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,892
Once you are done,
you'll have gotten us
one step closer

251
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,111
to saving the world.

252
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,062
What was that?

253
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,412
I've never been allergic
to lobster before.

254
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,762
The Bio-Link on the lenses
still isn't working.

255
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,591
Look, eating virtually
still provides the body
with nutrients,

256
00:12:02,634 --> 00:12:06,900
but the interface
is hyper-stimulating
the body's sensory reaction

257
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,250
into a kind of toxic shock.

258
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:15,125
Last week, we were
this close to perfecting
Obsidian Platinum.

259
00:12:16,213 --> 00:12:17,606
We need to fix this.

260
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:18,955
- Miss Rojas,

261
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,522
Lena Luthor is waiting
in your office.

262
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:27,921
Lena.

263
00:12:28,835 --> 00:12:30,662
Twice in one week.

264
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,273
It's getting to be
like old times.

265
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,970
Well, I know
you're gearing up for
the Platinum launch

266
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,756
and I was hoping
I could get a preview.

267
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,975
I loved
your first-generation lenses.

268
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:41,499
They were helpful to me
in so many ways.

269
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:42,849
So maybe I could get a peek?

270
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:44,024
Of course.

271
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:46,635
Except, we're not
quite ready yet.

272
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:48,768
Oh.

273
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:51,161
Is everything all right?

274
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,337
Yes, nothing major. Just, uh...

275
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,905
a small issue
with the Bio-Link algorithm.

276
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,212
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

277
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,868
You know, maybe I can help.

278
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:05,436
Luthor Corp's been working
with the Pentagon
on a new neural interface.

279
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,177
We've just developed
a special processor

280
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,614
that regulates Bio-Linking
across a wide spectrum.

281
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:13,140
It's completely eliminated
the feedback loop, gotten
most of the side effects.

282
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:15,533
Well, that's impressive,
but we're not the Pentagon.

283
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,971
And that's a good thing.
The Pentagon just dropped out,

284
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:20,712
leaving us with perhaps
the perfect interface for you.

285
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,192
So what do you say?

286
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,934
We help Obsidian North
revolutionize virtual reality?

287
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:26,762
I appreciate the offer,

288
00:13:28,024 --> 00:13:29,721
but our last attempt
at collaboration

289
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,288
almost ruined everything
between us.

290
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,509
I don't wanna risk that.

291
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:36,250
You're right.

292
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,036
But let me know
if you change your mind.

293
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,559
The offer still stands.

294
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:42,473
I will.

295
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,655
There is only one place
I think the AI can be.

296
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,876
In a prime server tower down
in the sub-basement corridor.

297
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,574
Now, the way that we find
which server the Toyman is on,

298
00:13:56,618 --> 00:14:00,927
is to physically go down
into the corridors
and search for it.

299
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,798
Luckily,
we had this in storage.

300
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,061
Van Eck radiation scanner.

301
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:07,237
It's delinked from our intranet

302
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,892
and able to distinguish
between normal server radiation
and abnormal radiation,

303
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,068
thereby allowing us
to pinpoint Toyman.

304
00:14:12,112 --> 00:14:14,331
Accordingly, I shall head
into the corridors.

305
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,898
No, Brainy,
we need you up here

306
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,205
in case Toyman tries to get
in the command center again.

307
00:14:18,248 --> 00:14:19,119
I'll go.

308
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:20,947
Uh, not without me.

309
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,383
Are you sure
you're up for this?

310
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:23,514
This is my enemy.

311
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,212
It's my problem.

312
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:28,606
Plus, I'm the only one
that knows the code.

313
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,738
Okay, fine.

314
00:14:29,781 --> 00:14:31,914
Winn, Supergirl,
go for the servers,

315
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,134
Brainy, you keep him
at bay digitally,

316
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:36,919
and I will make sure
that he doesn't get ahold
of any of our tech.

317
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:40,923
You know, it's so funny
because we have all these
eyes and ears in there

318
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:43,447
looking and listening
all the time, but...

319
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:45,362
who is watching who?

320
00:14:51,194 --> 00:14:52,152
Brainy.

321
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,591
I need to know.

322
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,680
Is this another step
in one of Lex's plans?

323
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,948
Lex did help manipulate
Toyman's digital reemergence

324
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,645
but I had nothing
to do with it.

325
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:10,953
Helping Lex is
what I have to do
for the sake of the future.

326
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:12,085
You know that.

327
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:15,436
Still, I promise

328
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:16,872
I have everything
under control.

329
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,742
Okay.

330
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:20,136
I am trusting you.

331
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,275
Doppio espresso.

332
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,451
To cheer you up?

333
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:32,583
What makes you think
I need cheering up?

334
00:15:32,627 --> 00:15:36,413
Well, you're trying to
advance your grand project.

335
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:38,763
The Q-waves from
the archive cube had helped,

336
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,897
but the next step remains...

337
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:43,855
elusive.

338
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:46,032
A Lex who cares about
the emotional state of others.

339
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,165
This really is
a whole new world.

340
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,081
I care because
your goals are my goals.

341
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,562
Ah, it does always come back
to you, doesn't it?

342
00:15:56,216 --> 00:15:59,001
But, yes, with the exception
of field testing,

343
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,569
my Non Nocere
algorithm is almost ready.

344
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:02,700
Just...

345
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,354
need a distribution device

346
00:16:04,398 --> 00:16:06,574
so I can get it to
as many people as possible
all at once.

347
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,882
I thought I'd come to
an agreement with Andrea
this evening, but--

348
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:13,189
She said no.

349
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:16,671
I have to say, Andrea was
always a bit short-sighted.

350
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:19,369
Perhaps there's something
I can do?

351
00:16:19,413 --> 00:16:21,067
I don't need
anyone murdered, Lex.

352
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,330
I have other skill sets.

353
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:24,766
Plus, we're partners.

354
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,247
Let me help.

355
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,466
Wait, are you actually
asking my permission?

356
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,946
It's a whole new world.

357
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,344
Fine.

358
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,614
Nice one.

359
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:47,745
Well, I try.

360
00:16:47,789 --> 00:16:49,356
I just wish
you didn't have to

361
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,749
on account of my dad's
global insanity nightmare--

362
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,882
It's not your fault.

363
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,058
Actually, it kinda is.

364
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,106
When I told you guys that
I remembered my dad's code,

365
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,239
I'm the one
that came up with it.

366
00:17:03,283 --> 00:17:05,111
Look, I thought
it would be cool.

367
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,591
Why just play a video game,
you know, when you can
be inside of one?

368
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:10,029
I'd stay up past midnight
trying to think
of different ways

369
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,858
to express Premack's theory
of the mind in this
little blue notebook.

370
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,383
My dad finally caught me
with it and asked me
what it was.

371
00:17:16,426 --> 00:17:18,124
I thought he was getting mad,
but he seemed...

372
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:21,127
He seemed proud.

373
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,216
Of course, now I know
it wasn't pride, it was greed.

374
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,261
The night the police finally
came and took him away,

375
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:26,306
I went to look
for the notebook.

376
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,307
It was gone.

377
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,873
Turns out that
he had taken it

378
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,702
and left in its place
a little toy monkey.

379
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,226
I'm sorry.

380
00:17:33,269 --> 00:17:35,054
Ah, it... It's fine.
Let's talk about
something else.

381
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,230
Hey. You and William.

382
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:38,361
-What's with that?
-What?

383
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:39,754
I totally messed him
asking you out.

384
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,495
-What? No, no. That was not...
-I messed that up.

385
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,800
Well, he wasn't...

386
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:45,151
-There's... There is
nothing there.
-What?

387
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,283
I'm sorry, but even
in the 30th century,

388
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,895
harmonizing that beautifully
with someone is a definitive
sign of something there.

389
00:17:50,939 --> 00:17:54,116
Maybe I like him.
I don't... I don't know.

390
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,857
The truth is,

391
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,251
given who I am
and the secrets I keep,

392
00:17:58,294 --> 00:18:00,514
I'm not sure I can
even have a relationship.

393
00:18:00,557 --> 00:18:03,125
My double life blew up
my friendship with Lena.

394
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,431
So how am I supposed
to date someone?

395
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,824
Just because Lena reacted
the way that she did

396
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,435
does not mean
that other people will.

397
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:11,481
Maybe so, but I refuse
to start any relationship
on a lie.

398
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:15,137
William asked you out
on one date, Kara.

399
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,313
You don't even know
if it's gonna go anywhere,

400
00:18:17,357 --> 00:18:19,576
but you won't find out
unless you try.

401
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,013
And then if it does,
you know, just...

402
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,319
take it one step at a time.

403
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:25,974
One step at a time, huh?

404
00:18:26,017 --> 00:18:27,149
-That's right.

405
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:28,107
-Whoa.

406
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:35,723
So we've got
the command center cleared.

407
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:37,333
But if Toyman comes back,

408
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,596
we cannot let him
get his digital hands
on any of this.

409
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,165
So, Squad 1, I want you
to pop the chips
out of every smart gun.

410
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,428
Squad 2, do the same
with communication tech.

411
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:48,388
Squad 3,
delink everything else.

412
00:18:48,431 --> 00:18:50,564
We've really outsmarted
ourselves here, haven't we?

413
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:52,392
All right, get to work.

414
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,049
Everyone, keep working.

415
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,094
I'll check it out.

416
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,367
Breach!

417
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,678
I think Toyman's
this way.

418
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:25,512
Toyman?

419
00:19:27,078 --> 00:19:28,254
Winslow.

420
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,429
At last you're here.

421
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:31,561
Dad.

422
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,220
The song. I...
I knew it was you.

423
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,353
Winn, I had to
get your attention.

424
00:19:40,396 --> 00:19:41,658
Oh, you got my attention.

425
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:43,094
-No, no. I'm here to help.
-No. Don't.

426
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,096
Explain yourself.

427
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,316
Winn knows.
Digitizing my consciousness
was my dream.

428
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,013
Yeah. A dream you stole.

429
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:51,494
Fine. But when that
other Winn digitized himself,

430
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:55,063
he used the underlying code
that I'd written,
plus my hardware.

431
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:57,544
Now, I managed to translate
80% of myself,

432
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,981
but he must have paired it with some sort of future tech,

433
00:20:00,024 --> 00:20:02,070
because when he came online,
I did too.

434
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:03,419
And now you wanna help us?

435
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,943
Yes. I'm trapped
in a backup drive,

436
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:08,207
and the only way
I can do anything is
if you release me.

437
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,643
I'm sorry. Are you insane?

438
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:11,122
Oh, wait, yes.

439
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,689
Clinically, you are.

440
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:14,648
If we let him go,
he will do what he always does

441
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:16,258
and wreak havoc everywhere.

442
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:17,520
That's not true!

443
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:19,653
I mean,
it was my original plan,

444
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:23,047
but this other Winn is planning to do things that are
beyond the pale.

445
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:24,658
I've seen it in his code.

446
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,529
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm going to delete
both of you.

447
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:27,574
But I wanna help.

448
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,445
And you can't beat him alone.

449
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:32,318
Supergirl, Winn,

450
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,363
apparently, three of
Toyman's sentries are headed
for you as we speak.

451
00:20:34,407 --> 00:20:35,886
What kind of sentries?

452
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,801
It seems that before
Toyman's AI got into our net,

453
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,282
it got into
some flying monkeys.

454
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,155
Supergirl, go this way.

455
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,548
-You'll be safe.

456
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:49,248
No, no, you are not fooling us.
Not now, not ever.

457
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,946
There is a service corridor
behind this wall.

458
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:52,947
Winslow, no!

459
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:12,923
Forgive my boldness
at this hour.

460
00:21:12,967 --> 00:21:15,839
It's just I saw you
across the room
and knew I had to pounce.

461
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,102
Lex Luthor.

462
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,409
You should be careful
where you pounce.

463
00:21:20,453 --> 00:21:21,976
You never know
what you might find.

464
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,980
Oh, but I do know
who you are.

465
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:27,851
Gemma Cooper.

466
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,679
Board chair of Obsidian North,

467
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,987
renowned computer scientist
with excellent taste
in wine, horses,

468
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,554
and business opportunities.

469
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,819
What kind of opportunities?

470
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:42,344
Mmm. The kind that can satisfy
both Obsidian North
and Luthor Corp.

471
00:21:42,388 --> 00:21:45,304
Funny. I don't think
there is much
we had in common.

472
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:48,481
Oh. I'd think a woman
of your vision and insight

473
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,700
would be able to see
past the superficial.

474
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:55,226
You have an interface issue
with the Obsidian Platinum
Bio-Link.

475
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,011
Today, my sister offered
to help fix it.

476
00:21:57,794 --> 00:22:00,362
Your CEO rejected her offer

477
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,495
because she let her feelings
determine her business moves,

478
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,323
and I think you're
smarter than that.

479
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,021
You're suggesting that we get
into bed with Luther Corp?

480
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,111
Since when is that smart?

481
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:13,070
Whenever it comes to
doing business anywhere
on this planet.

482
00:22:13,114 --> 00:22:14,942
You have amazing technology--

483
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:16,987
At least you almost do.

484
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:19,468
We have allies and assets,

485
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:22,993
government stooges
and supporters
in every corner of the globe.

486
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,779
That's the kind of reach
you can't get with just
a snap of your fingers.

487
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,477
So you have the potential,

488
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:30,349
but we can help you realize it.

489
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:33,656
And what do you expect
to get back in exchange
for this "help"?

490
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,312
The tech field can only hold
so many players.

491
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,968
Sooner or later,
there might not be room
for the both of us.

492
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:44,275
Why be at each other's throats
when we could be
joined at the hip?

493
00:22:44,972 --> 00:22:46,277
Who knows,

494
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,801
we might like it.

495
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:50,194
I can be an excellent friend

496
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:51,500
when I want to be.

497
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:53,720
And I do want
to be your friend...

498
00:22:54,938 --> 00:22:55,983
for a long time.

499
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,120
Are you okay?

500
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,644
I know the last time
you saw your father
was pretty horrible.

501
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,863
Trusting him never leads
to anything good.

502
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:09,692
I get that,
but "never" is a big word.

503
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:12,695
J'onn recently found himself
in a blood feud
with his brother

504
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:15,002
where he said they would
never make amends,

505
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,525
and now they're brothers
that support each other.

506
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,485
Yeah, well, good for J'onn,

507
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,922
but I am not trusting
Toyman No. 1 or 2
until they are both deleted.

508
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,317
Director Danvers,

509
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,145
the rest of the tablets
have been delinked.

510
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,582
Permission to delink yours?

511
00:23:29,625 --> 00:23:32,106
Um, no,
I'll take care of that,
thank you.

512
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:44,988
You son of a...

513
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,181
Brainy.

514
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,402
What the hell were you
doing in my account?

515
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,063
I trusted you
with that spyware.

516
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,760
And you hacked into my tablet

517
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:21,242
and you overrode my commands
and you deleted it.

518
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:23,505
Just tell me I'm wrong!

519
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,463
You're not wrong.

520
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:26,943
I did it.

521
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:27,857
I knew it.

522
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,599
You know what?

523
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,775
Ever since those other Brainys
got you to take off
your inhibitors,

524
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,473
you have been acting different,

525
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:37,127
and it's not some
personality different.

526
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,956
It's like you're
hiding something.

527
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,915
Like you've got
some secret plan.

528
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,222
I did it
to protect you, Alex.

529
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,746
Come on.

530
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,574
Sooner or later,
Lex would have
found your spyware,

531
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:49,923
he would have traced it
back to your account--

532
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,098
I knew the risk.

533
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,013
It isn't a risk, it's a fact.

534
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:54,754
Look, if this Toyman fiasco's
taught us anything,

535
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,539
it's that technology,
no matter how sophisticated,

536
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,628
can be used against us.

537
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:00,977
It's just a matter of when.

538
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:04,894
I should have told you first.

539
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:08,768
But I refuse to let
Lex come after you.

540
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,087
Gemma.

541
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:25,045
Is everything all right?

542
00:25:25,088 --> 00:25:27,177
Apparently not.

543
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:30,180
According to Lex Luthor,
our interface isn't working,

544
00:25:30,224 --> 00:25:32,269
and it's generating
catastrophic results.

545
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,184
Um, look,
that's an overstatement.

546
00:25:34,228 --> 00:25:36,665
And when you were
given the opportunity
to team up with them

547
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,058
to fix this issue,

548
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,669
you passed.

549
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:44,891
The Luthors may have
a slight scientific edge,
but...

550
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:48,068
Lena and I have not had
the best relationship
in the past.

551
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,853
This isn't about
your friendship with Lena.

552
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,681
It's about staying focused
on the business

553
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:55,118
that your father spent
his life building,

554
00:25:55,162 --> 00:25:57,381
that you yourself have brought
to the precipice

555
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:59,993
of one of the biggest
tech advancements in history.

556
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,125
I know where we stand.

557
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,910
Then I don't need to remind you
of all the other relationships
you've abandoned

558
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,476
to get this
where it needs to be.

559
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:09,002
The Luthors can help us.

560
00:26:13,223 --> 00:26:15,312
In college,

561
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,706
when I agreed
to be your mentor,

562
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,317
it was because I believed
you would never back down.

563
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,756
Maybe I was wrong.

564
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:45,473
Lena?

565
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:46,343
It's Andrea.

566
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,173
I think I've changed my mind.

567
00:26:50,217 --> 00:26:51,479
This is it.

568
00:26:51,522 --> 00:26:52,959
-Toyman's prime server.

569
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:54,090
So,
what happens now?

570
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,440
In a few clicks,

571
00:26:56,484 --> 00:26:58,399
this will all be over.

572
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:00,531
Is everything okay?

573
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:03,709
Code is not entering.

574
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:06,625
Brainy.

575
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,626
-Have you found the server?
- Yeah, we did,

576
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,018
but we're having a problem.

577
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,977
What is it?

578
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,153
Every time I try to enter
the kill code, it keeps
getting bounced back.

579
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,507
It seems Toyman's AI is
growing too strong for you

580
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,465
to access it anywhere
outside the server.

581
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,729
But how else do we access it?

582
00:27:23,772 --> 00:27:24,904
I have to go inside it.

583
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,212
I have this
from the Legion ship.

584
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:32,215
It allows me to enter
the digital space temporarily.

585
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,435
If you go inside it,
can't you run into--

586
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:37,960
My dad, or Toyman,
or... both.

587
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,222
Yeah.

588
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:42,051
What was that?

589
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:55,021
We have Lexosuits?

590
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,675
Toyman's AI
is inside of them.
Get out now.

591
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,352
They're breaking out.

592
00:28:22,396 --> 00:28:24,224
Toyman's tech is trying
to escape.

593
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,312
If it succeeds,

594
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:27,053
there is a 100% chance

595
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:30,186
that Toyman will be able to weaponize the entire Internet.

596
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,927
Go. I can do this.

597
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,973
-But your father--
-It's only code, okay?

598
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:35,626
And this is simple.
I go to it,

599
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,281
I enter the kill code,
and then I get out.
I can do this.

600
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:39,979
I mean, I have to do this.

601
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:40,893
Don't forget...

602
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,808
I'm Computer Lad.

603
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:02,001
Okay, what doesn't belong?

604
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:15,057
Gotcha.

605
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,103
-Winn!

606
00:29:17,146 --> 00:29:19,496
You... You shouldn't be
in here by yourself.

607
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,108
You won't be able
to hold him back alone.

608
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,283
You need me!

609
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,024
I do not need you!

610
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:29,115
Tag!

611
00:29:31,465 --> 00:29:32,683
You're it.

612
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:35,295
Open the doors
with the palm lock, son.

613
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:38,211
Just reach up
and do it.

614
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,256
Trust me, I've... I've changed!

615
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,432
You can't trust him.

616
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:45,000
I did all of this for him,

617
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,872
and look how he treats me.

618
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,569
That's because you're a psycho!

619
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:22,168
I got you. I got you.

620
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,314
Supergirl, you have to
get away from here.

621
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,012
I'm not leaving this fight.

622
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,970
Don't be crazy.
This isn't some time
to stick to some code.

623
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,542
Unless you're them.

624
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:50,370
Toyman may be controlling
our technology,

625
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,199
but that tech still keys
on sound, motion,
and brightness.

626
00:30:53,242 --> 00:30:57,768
Accordingly, if I become
the brightest and the loudest
in the room,

627
00:30:57,812 --> 00:30:59,335
then I'll be
the tech's only target.

628
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:02,034
And if it's focused on you,
we can focus on it.

629
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:06,603
Moths to a flame.

630
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:09,693
Winn! Just... Just let go!

631
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:11,391
He's right.

632
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,261
Let go.

633
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:14,873
The fall will kill you.

634
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,399
Just let go

635
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:20,791
because in here...

636
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,927
you can!

637
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:44,119
Leeroy Jenkins!

638
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,354
Winn,
please, just let me out

639
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:02,964
and we can stop him together!

640
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:03,965
No way!

641
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:08,361
Even this dummy knows
you're lying, Dad.

642
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:09,840
He knows.

643
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,321
If I get deleted, so do you.

644
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:14,933
All right. When I said
I changed, I lied.

645
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,370
I haven't changed in here,

646
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:22,201
but I have learned
looking through
the DEO's files here

647
00:32:22,244 --> 00:32:25,856
and all the good things
you've done for your friends
and for the world.

648
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,772
And it made me so proud, son.

649
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:32,646
I mean, I've always said
that you and I are alike,
but that... that's not true.

650
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:35,736
No. We're almost nothing alike.

651
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:41,394
You're simply
the best part of me.

652
00:32:41,437 --> 00:32:45,006
If there was ever a time
to... to take a leap,

653
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,051
it's now.

654
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,053
And like I said,

655
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,577
in here, you can do anything.
Look out!

656
00:32:57,888 --> 00:32:59,368
Go on, son!

657
00:32:59,412 --> 00:33:01,109
Finish entering the code.

658
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,137
Game over.

659
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:34,012
Supergirl, he's
trying to escape!

660
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:39,104
Not today.

661
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,635
No! No, stop!

662
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,292
Dad?

663
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:54,380
Finish it, son!

664
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,512
It's the only way!

665
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:10,396
Winn?

666
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,093
I'm here.

667
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,051
Are you okay?

668
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,186
My dad saved me.

669
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,581
He was telling the truth.

670
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,195
Sometimes, people
can surprise us.

671
00:34:45,518 --> 00:34:46,954
Nice to
see you back at work.

672
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:52,394
How did you access my phone?
I have this room shielded.

673
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:54,918
Just a little bit of tech
I've been working on.

674
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:58,008
But, really, I just
wanted to see if you'd
sorted things with Andrea.

675
00:34:58,052 --> 00:34:59,575
Clearly you have.

676
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:00,750
You know the words
you want to hear me say,
"Thank you."

677
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,275
Well, thank you.

678
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:05,233
You said you'd bring
Andrea around, and you did.

679
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,582
It was my pleasure.

680
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:08,280
Though, it's still a mystery

681
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:11,413
why Obsidian's tech
malfunctioned
in the first place.

682
00:35:11,457 --> 00:35:13,372
I suppose
it was just fortuitous

683
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:15,591
that you were
in the right place
to make the right move.

684
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:16,549
Is it really?

685
00:35:16,592 --> 00:35:18,464
Oh, Lena.

686
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:20,248
I am impressed.

687
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,337
Sabotaging your friend
to get what you want.

688
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,252
Not to get what I want.
For the good of humanity.

689
00:35:24,296 --> 00:35:26,385
Ah, of course.

690
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,126
But that is exactly
the kind of thinking

691
00:35:28,169 --> 00:35:30,345
we're going to need
to defeat Leviathan.

692
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,565
Your big brother
is proud of you.

693
00:35:32,608 --> 00:35:35,307
I don't suppose my big brother
wants to tell me what he did
to bring Andrea around.

694
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:38,962
I just made friends
with an Obsidian board chair,
Gemma Cooper.

695
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:41,661
If you ask me,
she'll be a friend to us both
for a long time.

696
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:56,023
Please tell the Anointed One
the Luthors are right
where we want them.

697
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:01,420
She will be most pleased.

698
00:36:01,463 --> 00:36:04,074
Here is all
the Kryptonite from the DEO.

699
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:06,816
That's the Lexosuits
and the lockdown shields.

700
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,557
Everything that we could grab.

701
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:12,170
I can still send
all of it into the sun.

702
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:15,564
Speaking of space, Alex,
I may have some
Martian eavesdropping tech

703
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,176
that Lex may find
hard to uncover,
if you're interested.

704
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:19,916
Well, you should
give it to Brainy...

705
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,136
'cause I'm quitting the DEO.

706
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:23,790
Alex, really?

707
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,792
Lex is everywhere in there,

708
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,490
and I can't keep showing up
and smiling at him,

709
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,840
and... Even if
it's just pretend.

710
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,016
Plus, now you can come
and work with me.

711
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,540
National City may need
the tower,

712
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,542
but the tower needs leaders.

713
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:38,500
Could be fun.

714
00:36:38,544 --> 00:36:40,023
Fun and logical.

715
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:42,983
Brainy, you should come too.

716
00:36:43,026 --> 00:36:44,767
I mean, why not
just work here?

717
00:36:44,811 --> 00:36:47,683
Ironically, the logic
that dictates you must leave

718
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,817
also dictates
that I must stay...

719
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:54,603
to provide you all
with eyes and ears
around Lex.

720
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:56,475
Your friends are always
gonna have your back, Brainy.

721
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,478
And you, Winn, how are you?

722
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:00,653
Oh, you know.

723
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:03,090
Ready to go home.

724
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,962
-Being here with you guys

725
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:09,314
has, I mean...
It... It's helped me

726
00:37:09,357 --> 00:37:11,620
a lot more than
the future ever could have.

727
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:13,970
Just... It's just helped me

728
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:16,712
get over my dad
and, you know, his crimes,

729
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:20,107
just my past,
all of it. So...

730
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:22,240
Thank you.

731
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,545
-Come on.

732
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:27,593
It's been good to see you.

733
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:28,768
All right.
Come here. Come here.

734
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:30,248
Ah, we'll see you soon,
Computer Lad.

735
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:33,251
No!  Okay, okay.

736
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,687
Listen.

737
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,080
It's not Computer Lad
anymore, all right?

738
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:38,256
From now on...

739
00:37:39,996 --> 00:37:40,997
it's Toyman.

740
00:37:41,781 --> 00:37:43,043
Winn, seriously?

741
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,567
Yeah.

742
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:48,831
You guys, when I told you
that I was okay
being called Computer Lad,

743
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,704
are you kidding me?
No, I hated that.
"Computer Lad."

744
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,053
-No.

745
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:54,272
What?

746
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,143
But "Toyman..."

747
00:37:57,666 --> 00:37:59,189
You know, that name has
always haunted me.

748
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:03,368
But now after having faced
my father...

749
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,936
He told me that
I was better than him.

750
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:08,634
And he was right.

751
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,637
So I'm gonna reclaim that name.

752
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,595
- Hmm.
-And make it stand for good.

753
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:15,597
Hey, it's like the Doctor said,

754
00:38:15,641 --> 00:38:18,121
"The future is
whatever you want..."

755
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:19,253
"So make it a good one."

756
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,037
Nice, "Doc" Brown.

757
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:22,038
Thank you.

758
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,431
All right, guys.

759
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:26,652
That's my ride.

760
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:29,350
Oh, hey. Hey.

761
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:31,309
I know that
you can't do anything
about Lena right now,

762
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:34,007
but just give it time.

763
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:37,837
And with William,
you don't have to start
a relationship with a lie.

764
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,449
Just see where it goes.

765
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:42,668
One step at a time.

766
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,063
Yeah.

767
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:48,021
I'll miss you.

768
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,285
Okay. That's enough.

769
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,351
Hello, Kara.

770
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:14,743
Hello.

771
00:39:15,962 --> 00:39:17,355
So, uh, I was thinking,

772
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,182
-um--
-Just one second.
I'm sorry.

773
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:23,752
It's for your Gran Gran.

774
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:26,712
The one who was sick.

775
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:28,540
Oh, right.

776
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,673
My grandma.

777
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:33,936
My grandmother swears
a good puzzle is better
than antibiotics.

778
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,721
So.

779
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,418
You were saying?

780
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:39,942
Yeah. Uh...

781
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,641
I was thinking...

782
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:48,386
I'm sorry, William,
I just don't feel
that way about you.

783
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:51,476
Ah...

784
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:54,087
I understand.

785
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,917
I'm sorry for misreading
the situation.

786
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,440
No, no, it's fine.

787
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:00,528
I'll see you later.

788
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:01,964
Yeah.

789
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:13,062
There.

790
00:40:14,586 --> 00:40:17,066
Toyman's immortality code.

791
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:18,894
I was able to pull
the relevant sections

792
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:22,768
while everyone else
was distracted.

793
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:27,076
You are
a very useful employee,
Agent Dox.

794
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,385
Also, I should add
Director Danvers no longer
poses a threat to you

795
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,995
or our operation.

796
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:34,823
Perfect.

797
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:38,348
Especially as I just received
her resignation.

798
00:40:38,392 --> 00:40:41,961
So, it would seem
congratulations are in order.

799
00:40:43,049 --> 00:40:44,050
Congratulations.

800
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:46,922
To you...

801
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:48,924
DEO Director Dox.

802
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,365
So, how did it go?

803
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:58,151
He asked about
my sick grandmother.

804
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:00,501
-And I had to go with it.

805
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:03,069
It was the first thing
out of my mouth,
and it was a lie.

806
00:41:03,112 --> 00:41:05,811
And then I just... left.

807
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:09,684
I can battle
Kryptonite-powered Lexosuits,

808
00:41:09,728 --> 00:41:11,773
but I can't even take
the first step
in a relationship

809
00:41:11,817 --> 00:41:14,428
because it is doomed
with deception.

810
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,777
You don't know that for sure.

811
00:41:15,821 --> 00:41:18,301
Well, it happened
with my friendship with Lena.

812
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:20,608
And I can't help
thinking that...

813
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,480
if I had done
things differently,

814
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,743
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

815
00:41:24,786 --> 00:41:26,658
There is just...
There's no way of knowing.

816
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:32,011
Oh, that probably
J'onn with the pizza,

817
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:33,708
which is great.

818
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:34,709
Hi!

819
00:41:36,798 --> 00:41:38,757
Some say
there's no way of knowing.

820
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,674
But I say, first,
ask Mr. Mxyzptlk.
