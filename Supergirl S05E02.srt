00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,654
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:03,655
I'm sorry, who are you?

3
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:04,743
Andrea Rojas.

4
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:06,832
I sold CatCo
to Andrea.

5
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:07,877
Tomorrow,
we'll be joined by

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,096
the renowned
William Day.

7
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,445
From
The Times of London?

8
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:11,315
I quit.

9
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,577
But I have a calling, Hope,

10
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:14,318
and it's to fix mankind.

11
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,146
I never thought Supergirl
would tell me who she was,

12
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,366
but now that she has,
I have an opportunity,

13
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:20,759
and I can use Supergirl
to achieve my ends.

14
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:23,849
Who are you?

15
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:26,591
You don't recognize me.
Brother.

00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,165

Thank you, Supergirl.

24
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:10,331
Yeah.

25
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:12,202
That woman shouldn't
have been texting and walking.

26
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,291
...as citizens
of National City

27
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:15,205
prepare to head
to the ballot box
for the upcoming midterms.

28
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:17,294
Obsidian North contact lenses,

29
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:19,122
they let you do you,

30
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,386
whenever, wherever,
and whatever you want.

31
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,431
Seriously?

32
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,437
As if you weren't
amazing enough,

33
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,700
you're also a gourmet chef?

34
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:32,831
Hardly.

35
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,138
But I am famous

36
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,358
-for this breakfast
in particular.
-Oh.

37
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,099
So, we have poached eggs,

38
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,535
crispy bacon,

39
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,014
fresh whipped cream,

40
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:43,929
and...

41
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,931
Danvers'
blueberry pancakes.

42
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:47,672
-Um...
-I know, right?

43
00:01:47,716 --> 00:01:49,196
One bite of these

44
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:51,589
and you will die for them.

45
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,938
I really will.

46
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,157
What's wrong?

47
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:56,116
I'm not the biggest fan
of blueberries.

48
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,466
-Oh!
-In fact, I'm deadly allergic.

49
00:01:58,857 --> 00:01:59,945
You are?

50
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,251
When I was four,
I ate a handful of them,

51
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,905
and my throat closed up,

52
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,429
and my face probably turned
the color of those blueberries.

53
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:06,256
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,128
I... I am so sorry.

55
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,172
It's okay. I was four.

56
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,782
No, but I nearly
just killed you.

57
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,306
Okay, you didn't
just kill me,

58
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:14,656
and I always carry
an emergency EpiPen with me.

59
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,223
Really?

60
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,746
I didn't know that.

61
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,139
Hey, it's all good.

62
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,619
Also, bacon and whipped cream

63
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:24,448
happen to be two of
my most favorite foods

64
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,275
on the planet.

65
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,755
So, you don't really like

66
00:02:26,798 --> 00:02:28,800
poached eggs either, do you?

67
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,237
Not so much.

68
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,761
But do you know
what I like more than anything?

69
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:33,762
Mmm-mmm.

70
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:35,546
You.

71
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,895
Okay.

72
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:39,855
Thank you.

73
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,161
I need breakfast.

74
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,771
And coffee.

75
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,990
Yes, this is your pattern,

76
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,167
which is why
I've prepared accordingly.

77
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:50,170
Breakfast burritos!

78
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,997
With chorizo and crema,

79
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,564
as you like.

80
00:02:53,608 --> 00:02:56,132
Plus your nitro-coffee with
an extra shot of cold brew.

81
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
This is
the best morning ever.

82
00:02:58,787 --> 00:02:59,875
"Best morning ever"?

83
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:02,312
But that would include eons,

84
00:03:02,356 --> 00:03:05,315
both before and after
this moment.

85
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,187
I really think
you're misusing the ter--

86
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,321
Message received.

87
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:15,586
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

88
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,286
Andrea bought CatCo
to get free global advertising

89
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,200
for Obsidian North.

90
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,201
And then this morning

91
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,332
on the jumbotron

92
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,769
an important story about
the election

93
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:25,944
was swallowed up

94
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:28,208
by a gigantic
Obsidian commercial.

95
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,557
-It's...

96
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,559
Well, speaking of
the upcoming election,

97
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,256
I got some interesting news
last night.

98
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,692
I got a call

99
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:35,737
from a group of people

100
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,521
who want to back me
for senator.

101
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:38,653
Senator?

102
00:03:38,696 --> 00:03:40,089
-Yeah.
-That's incredible.

103
00:03:40,132 --> 00:03:42,091
I never imagined
going into politics.

104
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,484
Are you kidding me?

105
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,312
We would all be lucky
to have you in Washington.

106
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,227
I also have an offer to be

107
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,446
the media director
at the Smithsonian.

108
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,709
Uh, so how long has it been

109
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:54,843
since you left CatCo,
what, 12 hours? That's...

110
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,455
That's the universe telling me
I'm on the right path.

111
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,718
Uh, well, I think
the universe is just telling me

112
00:04:00,762 --> 00:04:02,807
that I have to keep
my spirits up

113
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,592
and fight the good fight.

114
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:06,463
Your spirits
do seem remarkably high

115
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:09,074
for someone who strongly
dislikes her new boss.

116
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:11,816
Well, that's thanks to Lena.

117
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,427
I don't think I realized

118
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,298
how burdened I was
by lying to her.

119
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,257
And now that she knows
I'm Supergirl,

120
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,475
and she's forgiven me,

121
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,043
I feel 1,000 pounds lighter.

122
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,479
Like I can do anything.

123
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:23,524
Bring it!

124
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,091
J'onn, we got you a latte.

125
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,529
Oh, my God.

126
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:29,443
J'onn?

127
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:30,748
J'onn?

128
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:31,967
-J'onn!

129
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:43,283
Well, this should help
take away the pain temporarily.

130
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:44,458
I don't understand.

131
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:46,503
You think that
whoever did this to you

132
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,592
was also the person
that released Midnight?

133
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:49,680
Yes.

134
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:52,553
He said
he was my brother.

135
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:55,120
At first, I didn't believe him,
but now I know it must be true.

136
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:56,731
How do you know?

137
00:04:56,774 --> 00:05:00,387
This is specifically
a Martian form of agony.

138
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,563
In the early days of Mars,

139
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,652
there were two brothers:
Phobos and Deimos.

140
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,263
Their rivalry and bloodshed

141
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,135
was the reason for
the split of the Green
and White Martians.

142
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,660
To prevent this
ever happening again,

143
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,966
a curse was placed on
the Green Martians.

144
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,796
We called it Fa'ra'too'rik.

145
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,059
It is the punishment for
brother attacking brother.

146
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:23,888
But you've never even mentioned
having a brother.

147
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,455
I never knew of one.

148
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:28,502
Seems unthinkable.

149
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,373
But perhaps his existence

150
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,157
was hidden from me
by my parents.

151
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,160
And hidden by
the entire Martian community
by their hive mind?

152
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,379
We're going to find him,

153
00:05:36,423 --> 00:05:38,686
but first we need
to deal with your pain.

154
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,863
There is no cure for this
on this planet.

155
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,082
There is in the future.

156
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,694
We treat afflicted Euphorians,

157
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:50,132
an alien race with similar
brain structure to Martians,

158
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,481
with Q-waves.

159
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,397
They are narrow waveforms

160
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,834
that exist between
X and gamma rays.

161
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:58,836
You haven't heard of them

162
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,185
because Q-waves
don't get discovered

163
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:02,492
until sometime
in the late dark ages.

164
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:05,147
Actually, Kelly's been
using Q-waves

165
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,455
as part of her
brain computer interface
at Obsidian.

166
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:11,414
Well, no time like the present
to create the future.

167
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:14,678
Oh...

168
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:15,940
Nia?

169
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:17,202
Kara,

170
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,508
you need
to get here immediately.

171
00:06:18,552 --> 00:06:20,380
Ms. Rojas is on a rampage,

172
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,470
and she won't start
the editorial meeting
until everyone's present.

173
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,385
I'm on my way.

174
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,256
-You guys get J'onn to Kelly.
-Okay.

175
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:28,562
And I'll have the DEO

176
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,433
start a broadband scan
for Green Martians ASAP.

177
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:32,870
J'onn,

178
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:34,481
we're going to
find your brother.

179
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:38,833
Who hurt you?

180
00:06:38,876 --> 00:06:40,617
I went to see my brother.

181
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,706
He struck at me

182
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,970
and inflicted us both with
the sting of Fa'ra'too'rik.

183
00:06:46,014 --> 00:06:48,408
I cannot cure your affliction,

184
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,800
but I will do what I can

185
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,933
to ease your suffering,
old friend.

186
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:53,413
Once I am able,

187
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:56,807
I will tear this new family
of J'onn J'onzz's apart,

188
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,982
for both of us.

189
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:04,641
Hope?

190
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,164
Good morning,
Ms. Luthor.

191
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,078
Is it morning?

192
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,603
I lost track of time.

193
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,780
I had an epiphany last night.

194
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,434
There's something
in these lenses

195
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,044
of the Obsidian technology

196
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:18,307
that's going to allow me
to change the course
of humanity.

197
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,440
That is
an exciting agenda.

198
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,616
What is
your scientific hypothesis?

199
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:24,966
Hope, could you hurt someone?

200
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:26,881
I am incapable
of causing pain.

201
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:28,839
It is against
my prime directive.

202
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,406
Exactly.

203
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,321
Because you were built
in the very image
of perfection.

204
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,062
You have
no selfish inclinations.

205
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:37,979
Your base code is morality,
empathy, and logic.

206
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:41,548
Humans and aliens,
however, are flawed.

207
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,506
They are driven
by their emotions.

208
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,377
They lie, cheat,

209
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,292
and hurt each other
to protect themselves.

210
00:07:47,336 --> 00:07:48,293
But it's not their fault,

211
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:49,904
it's just
how they're programed.

212
00:07:50,687 --> 00:07:52,341
I am going to make them better

213
00:07:52,384 --> 00:07:54,082
with Project Non Nocere.

214
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,518
Do no harm.

215
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,867
I'm going to rid humanity

216
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,565
of its instincts
to hurt each other.

217
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:01,437
But you cannot reprogram
organic creatures.

218
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,873
The VR lenses create a link

219
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:05,354
between what we want
and what we see,

220
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,356
constructing a blank slate
in the brain

221
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:09,706
on which
a new world can be projected.

222
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,839
If I can find the source
of that link,

223
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:15,407
I can redirect the blank slate
to have one single rule.

224
00:08:15,451 --> 00:08:17,366
Non Nocere.Do no harm.

225
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:20,500
Is there anything I can do
to assist you in this endeavor?

226
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:21,631
You will eventually,

227
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,067
but right now,
I need more resources.

228
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,070
The subject
is gaining consciousness.

229
00:08:27,245 --> 00:08:28,508
Good.

230
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,770
I'm ready for her.

231
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:38,561
How did you sleep?

232
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,350
Kara!

233
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:47,222
Nia. There you are.

234
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,658
We can finally get started.

235
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:54,838
What's this?

236
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,884
A gift! From Obsidian North.

237
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,407
From now on

238
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,540
all work will be filed
through a portal

239
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,629
only accessible
through these tablets.

240
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,282
Thanks, boss.

241
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,762
At The Timeswe were lucky
if we got a legal pad.

242
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:08,069
Didn't you say
your wife was a lawyer?

243
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,506
Shouldn't you have a house
filled with legal pads?

244
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,812
Yeah. Right.

245
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,901
Which just makes this
all the more special.

246
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,078
Now,
for writing assignments,

247
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,732
I need interesting takes.

248
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,602
Kara,

249
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:20,647
you're on the fashion beat.

250
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,041
Um... That's not
really my style.

251
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:25,260
Style? Cute.

252
00:09:25,303 --> 00:09:26,566
You're witty.

253
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:27,871
I thought it would be
meta for you to cover

254
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:30,221
the "Who wore what?"
to your Pulitzer party.

255
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:32,659
I think I'd actually
prefer to do something
a little more...

256
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,661
Elitist? Yes, we all know that

257
00:09:34,704 --> 00:09:36,706
you can do
highbrow journalism.

258
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,883
I want to see
how low you can go.

259
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:41,493
It'll be good for you
to stretch that muscle.

260
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,757
Well, I'm always looking
to stretch my craft.

261
00:09:44,453 --> 00:09:45,759
In fact, I, uh...

262
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,630
I may have a beat on
a new senate candidate.

263
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,110
Maybe I can get us
an exclusive,

264
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:51,634
have them announce
their race on our website.

265
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,114
That is a good story.

266
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:54,811
So, you know what I think?

267
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,683
I think you should do both.

268
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:57,814
But mine first.

269
00:09:57,858 --> 00:09:59,686
And I want it on my desk
by lunch.

270
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,470
Thank you.

271
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:03,341
Um... I actually don't know
if I have time, but...

272
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:08,651
Here you go.

273
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:11,959
Okay, we're gonna go slow.

274
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:14,048
And I'm going to be here
monitoring your brain activity

275
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,615
and your vitals
the whole time.

276
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,617
And James is right outside,
if we need anything.

277
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,835
All right.

278
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:28,628
-Initiating energy cycle.

279
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,979
Q-wave protocol initiated.

280
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,942
Please... Please let me go.

281
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,771
I know that you're mad at me,
but just know that

282
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:45,557
I would be the most loyal
to you, if you let me live.

283
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:46,863
Okay, I'm not mad at you.

284
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,735
-Then why am I here?
-Why did you betray me?

285
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:52,434
I swear I didn't want to,
and that's true. It's just...

286
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:58,092
-They made me do it.
-Who is they? Lex's cronies?

287
00:10:58,135 --> 00:10:59,920
I can't.

288
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,662
-They're everywhere.
-All right.

289
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,359
Blame the bogeyman.

290
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,927
Please, if they even think that
I told you, they will kill me,

291
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,450
and they will kill you too.

292
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:09,799
Why should I believe
anything you say?

293
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,148
Because it's true.

294
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:15,326
They recruited me
when I was 16.

295
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,328
Same year my parents died.

296
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:19,504
I was already in college.

297
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:20,854
I had so much debt.

298
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,508
They said
they could fix everything.

299
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:25,336
All I had to do
was work for them.

300
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,860
-And betray me.
-No!

301
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:29,558
I hated doing it.
It hurt me every time.

302
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,038
Eve, I asked you
a question.

303
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,692
My mother always said

304
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,302
actions speak
louder than words.

305
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:36,217
And I was there, Eve.

306
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,001
I was on the other side
of that gun you pulled,

307
00:11:38,045 --> 00:11:39,176
and I looked down the barrel,

308
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,178
and I knew,
that you would've shot me.

309
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,747
So don't tell me
that you didn't have a choice.

310
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:47,663
There is always a choice,

311
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,187
and you always chose
the same thing.

312
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:52,973
You betrayed me
because you wanted to.

313
00:11:53,016 --> 00:11:54,714
You liked the power
that it gave you.

314
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:57,412
So, if you want me
to trust you,

315
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,111
try telling the truth for once.

316
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,904
Hey, Alex, I'm so sorry.

317
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:12,209
I think I'm stuck here

318
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,776
until I'm done
with these assignments.

319
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,473
Andrea's been
all over me today.

320
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:19,303
But the second you get a hit,
I'll blow out of here. Okay.

321
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,177
Nia?

322
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:24,482
Hey!

323
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:26,049
Whoa.

324
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,182
You have a bento box fort.

325
00:12:28,225 --> 00:12:29,009
Yup, yeah, I do.

326
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:30,271
-Can I have some?
-Yes!

327
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,794
-I'm starving
-Yes, please, take them all.

328
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,014
I'm still stuffed
from breakfast.

329
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,493
Let me guess. Is this Brainy?

330
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,757
This morning, he brought me
my favorite breakfast,

331
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,497
and it was perfect.

332
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,284
I don't know,
isn't this a little excessive?

333
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:47,331
Maybe giving food
is Brainy's language
of love. I don't know.

334
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,769
Well, I think
I just need to tell him
in plain English

335
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,989
that this is 35 boxes of sushi
too much love.

336
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:54,556
Yeah, that sounds
like a very healthy

337
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:55,862
and mature thing to do.

338
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:57,341
But I'm going to enjoy this
while it lasts.

339
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:58,473
All right. Well...

340
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:03,695
Great.

341
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:05,523
More reason
to get this done quickly.

342
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,792
I just reconfigured
all possible energy signatures

343
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,228
based on J'onn's DNA.

344
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,534
Mmm. You really are
on top of it all, Brainy.

345
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,580
I really am, aren't I?

346
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:19,973
I began this morning

347
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,105
by executing
a perfect breakfast
for Nia Nal.

348
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,456
She called it
"the best morning ever."

349
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,631
And as of 10 minutes ago,

350
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:28,764
she's having
an even better afternoon.

351
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:29,896
She is welcome.

352
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,549
You see, the key
to a good relationship

353
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:33,290
is knowing each other fully.

354
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:36,163
Hmm, I don't know
if that's really true.

355
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,556
Your voice just went up
two octaves.

356
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,384
Is everything all right?

357
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,040
Everything is great.

358
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,828
Except I almost kind of
poisoned Kelly this morning,

359
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,481
but it was
just a silly mistake.

360
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:51,918
Sounds like a deadly mistake.

361
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,531
I didn't know
she was allergic
to blueberries.

362
00:13:56,574 --> 00:13:57,662
Okay?

363
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:59,577
How could I?
She never told me that.

364
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:00,840
And then I started thinking,

365
00:14:00,883 --> 00:14:02,842
"Okay, well, what else
hasn't she told me?

366
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,322
What else might I
accidently kill her with?"

367
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,543
Because
I really like her, Brainy,

368
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,675
like, like a lot.

369
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:12,416
And I don't want to kill her.

370
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,202
You and Kelly are still in the
"getting to know you" stage.

371
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:17,073
Okay, but that's what
I'm talking about.

372
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,075
When did this happen?

373
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,817
When did my feelings for Kelly
get so strong,

374
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,732
and how could I possibly
feel this way

375
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,908
about somebody
that I barely know?

376
00:14:26,822 --> 00:14:28,780
From what I've learned,

377
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,478
the heart

378
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,653
is not logical.

379
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:38,486
Okay, we're going to
40 biohertz now.

380
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,488
Q-wave protocol initiated.

381
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:45,145
Turn it off.

382
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,929
What's going on?

383
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,932
Pain has just got worse.

384
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,893
Oh, there's something off
on your scan.

385
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:56,983
Okay, part of what
this tech does

386
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,202
is it maps and catalogs
your memories.

387
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:02,727
Okay, these rings represent
every year of your life.

388
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:04,381
Think of them like tree rings.

389
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:07,254
You see these? They're broken.

390
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,866
Have you ever had illness
or brain trauma before?

391
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,129
I've had many battles.

392
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:15,175
Didn't you also inherit
Myr'nn's memories?

393
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:17,481
Maybe that's causing
a rift in your own?

394
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,570
Okay. We should
rule out everything.

395
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:21,442
And if you want,

396
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,922
we can further
explore the breaks.

397
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,053
It might help us figure out

398
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,185
a better way
to stop your pain.

399
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:26,751
Whatever you think will help.

400
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,405
Okay.

401
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:29,624
I'm gonna go in with him,

402
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:31,495
make sure nobody
interrupts us.

403
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,496
-Got it.
-Okay.

404
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,025
Ready?

405
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,635
Initiating...

406
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,551
Pushing to 60 biohertz now.

407
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,250
First, we build.

408
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:50,036
I find it's easiest
for patients to create a method

409
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,212
for organizing their memories.

410
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:54,127
Imagine somewhere familiar.

411
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:08,793
You see how some of
these spines are blank?

412
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,318
This must have been the breaks
that I saw on the scan.

413
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:17,889
Battle of L'Zoril M'nt.

414
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,674
Battle of C'arel.

415
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:24,026
These are battles
of the Martian Civil War.

416
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,597
There's something about...

417
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:31,991
this one.

418
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,661
I've never seen this before.

419
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,013
It's Martian.

420
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,723
What do you think
that void means?

421
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,768
Someone wiped my mind.

422
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,953
I just located J'onn's brother,

423
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,520
five miles from here.

424
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:25,044
Great.
Get everyone out there,

425
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:26,393
I'll call Supergirl.

426
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:38,100
Hey...

427
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,756
Alex. Hey.

428
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,108
Sure. I just...

429
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,023
It's him?

430
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:51,418
Don't make contact with him
until I'm there.

431
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,333
Yeah. I'll sneak out of here
and meet you.

432
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,076
Where you going?

433
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,686
Everything okay?

434
00:17:58,729 --> 00:18:00,209
It's a family emergency.

435
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:08,739
Hey.

436
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,698
I know the NSA
doesn't do this anymore,

437
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,569
but you owe me a favor.

438
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,702
I need you to track
someone in National City.

439
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:17,052
Last name Danvers,

440
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,271
first name Kara.

441
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:29,673
Glad to see you've escaped
your tower, Rapunzel.

442
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:31,632
Yeah, and into a sewer.

443
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:32,937
Where's J'onn's brother?

444
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,593
Who would mind-wipe you?

445
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,726
Only another Martian
would be strong enough.

446
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,511
But wiping a Martian's mind

447
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:44,384
is the greatest sin
in Martian culture.

448
00:18:44,427 --> 00:18:47,126
Well, we could
rebuild your memory

449
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,476
based on what you already know.

450
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,782
Repairing the break
could also help ease your pain.

451
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:54,829
I'm not sure I can face
what's inside that void.

452
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:56,613
J'onn...

453
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,007
I... I know

454
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,009
that looking into your past
can be terrifying.

455
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,445
When I did it,

456
00:19:02,489 --> 00:19:04,230
I thought I might
lose myself for good.

457
00:19:04,273 --> 00:19:05,840
But Kelly was right by my side,

458
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:08,886
and I came back stronger.

459
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,717
Give me those contacts.

460
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:21,160
Brainy,
are we close
to J'onn's brother?

461
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:25,207
There seems to be interference
with the signal.

462
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,514
What kind of interference?

463
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,170
It's unclear.

464
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:36,871
There's something else
in here too.

465
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,486
Are you sure
this is where Kara Danvers is?

466
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,922
Yep. That's where she is.

467
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,368
What are you doing here?

468
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,239
Get out! Now!

469
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,680
Remember, this world
is a construct.

470
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:06,814
Nothing in here is by accident.

471
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:11,210
The book
that led you to the void,

472
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,386
you said it was about
the Martian Civil War?

473
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,910
It was the darkest moment
in Martian history.

474
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,914
In fact, it ended our history.

475
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,310
The White Martians attacked us,

476
00:20:25,528 --> 00:20:27,574
sabotaging us on every front.

477
00:20:28,966 --> 00:20:30,446
Including our minds.

478
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,582
How did they sabotage you?

479
00:20:36,365 --> 00:20:38,237
I don't know.

480
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:40,543
Yes, you do.

481
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:47,637
That's him.

482
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,729
Don't hurt them.

483
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,647
My brother was a traitor.

484
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:02,304
He poisoned us
with H'ronmeer's Curse.

485
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,741
We went before
the High Council.

486
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,308
Malefic betrayed us,

487
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:09,224
worked with the White Martians to poison our people.

488
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,617
He is not one of us.

489
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,923
Send him to the Phantom Zone.

490
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,632
You are still in the dark,
Brother.

491
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,680
Q-wave protocol completed.

492
00:21:30,724 --> 00:21:31,594
The pain...

493
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:35,772
It's gone.

494
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,776
Thank you, Brother.

495
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,921
Alex, watch out.
It's J'onn's brother.

496
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:54,835
No!

497
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,062
He's gone.

498
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,635
That was Kelly on the phone.

499
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:14,376
J'onn's okay. His pain is gone.

500
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,421
Well, that's a relief.

501
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,770
Are you finding anything?

502
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,119
Negative.

503
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,468
I lost his signal
when he and the White Martian

504
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,774
phased out of the sewer.

505
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:22,297
I will reconfigure
his signature

506
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,126
to include both Green
and White Martian energy.

507
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:26,867
Great, then we'll
get back to the DEO.

508
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,347
-Wow! I'm sorry.
-What?

509
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,479
-You smell.

510
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,351
But you smell of sewer.

511
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:35,441
Maybe a change of clothes
could help.

512
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,616
Wow.

513
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:37,965
He's not wrong about the smell.

514
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:39,575
Okay. Well, y'all smell, too.
How about that?

515
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,403
Worry not, the work is handled.

516
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:48,758
-Oh, hey, Nia. What is it?

517
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:52,371
Kara, Ms. Rojas is furious.
Where are you?

518
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,589
On my way.

519
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,504
I'll stay with J'onn tonight,

520
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:56,679
in case his brother comes back.

521
00:22:56,723 --> 00:22:58,420
But I have to do
some damage control

522
00:22:58,464 --> 00:22:59,987
-at CatCo first.
-Okay.

523
00:23:11,477 --> 00:23:13,435
Kara. It's after lunch,

524
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,481
and I haven't even received
your first article yet.

525
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:16,917
I was just about to file that.

526
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,222
William already did.

527
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,833
He wrote my article?

528
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:20,877
And it's excellent,

529
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,401
I may add.

530
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,751
Perhaps the transition is
harder on you than I thought.

531
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:27,231
Our copy editing staff
is a little shorthanded.

532
00:23:27,275 --> 00:23:29,495
Maybe you can help them out.

533
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:32,367
I'm... I'm not a copy editor.

534
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,891
A beginner's mind
is a Zen mind.

535
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:40,984
Really?

536
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:42,072
Broken?

537
00:23:42,116 --> 00:23:43,596
Intentionally?

538
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,206
And you're certain
it's that user?

539
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:47,774
I'll handle it.

540
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,953
The pile on the right
is for you.

541
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,267
Don't ever steal
one of my stories again.

542
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,443
Hey, I did you a favor.

543
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,575
Yeah? What kind of
twisted logic is it

544
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,622
that makes you think that
by stealing one of my bylines
you're doing me a favor?

545
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,885
And tattling on me?
What are you, five?

546
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:14,670
Maybe if you focused
on the work actually
assigned to you,

547
00:24:14,714 --> 00:24:16,150
you wouldn't have this problem.

548
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:18,935
Well, maybe if you supported
your fellow journalists

549
00:24:18,979 --> 00:24:22,939
instead of competing with them
you wouldn't be such a jerk.

550
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:25,812
Do I look like a guy
who does charity?

551
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,901
You want someone
to look out for you?

552
00:24:27,944 --> 00:24:29,206
Look somewhere else.

553
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,295
Well, since you enjoy
doing my work so much,

554
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,471
have at it.

555
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:37,519
I've been thinking about
what you said.

556
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,478
You're right.

557
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,002
I wasn't motivated by fear

558
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,612
or blackmail.

559
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:46,485
Every decision that I made,

560
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,574
every crummy thing
that I did to you,

561
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:51,664
to everyone, I wanted to do it.

562
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,188
I liked doing it.

563
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:55,232
Lena.

564
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:01,108
Andrea? How did
you get down here?

565
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,545
Oh, your assistant

566
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,547
is my best friend's girlfriend.

567
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:07,027
Cute couple.

568
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,855
Surprised you didn't know.

569
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:10,857
You shouldn't
underestimate me, Lena.

570
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:12,946
Do you really think

571
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,035
that I don't know when someone
is trying to steal my IP?

572
00:25:16,384 --> 00:25:18,081
You put trackers in the lenses.

573
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,213
And you shattered it,

574
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,346
along with
the Lumus pixellator.

575
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,610
But you already knew that.

576
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:26,742
That's what you were trying
to anatomize, wasn't it?

577
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:31,181
You know, I really thought
more of you, Lena.

578
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,272
Caught trying to steal
my technology?

579
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,971
How embarrassing for you.

580
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,540
What would
your shareholders think?

581
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,889
Or the world?

582
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:48,547
Oh, and I ran diagnostics
before you...

583
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,896
shattered these.

584
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:53,552
I know how valuable
they are to you.

585
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,162
How many hours
you've spent in them.

586
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,817
You're cut off.

587
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,775
You won't get
another pair from me.

588
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,777
Keep screwing with me,

589
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:04,563
and you won't
just owe me a story.

590
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,129
You'll be the story.

591
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:13,920
Lena.

592
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,139
I could have called for help,

593
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,750
and all of this would have been
over in one minute.

594
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:19,490
But I didn't.

595
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,883
Because I meant what I said.

596
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,277
You can trust me.

597
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:26,846
Yes,

598
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:29,326
it appears that I can.

599
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,594
No matter how I reconfigure
the Green Martian
energy signature,

600
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:38,597
I cannot get a hit
besides J'onn J'onzz himself.

601
00:26:41,295 --> 00:26:42,252
Thank you.

602
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,256
Nia!

603
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,258
You are welcome.

604
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:51,000
I assume you received
the pizza delivery.

605
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:52,436
Thank you

606
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,916
for the pizzas

607
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,788
but my dress is bursting
at the seams,

608
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,441
and I'm pretty sure
I have heartburn.

609
00:26:57,485 --> 00:27:00,619
Hmm, yes. My heart also burns.

610
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,882
You're not listening to me.

611
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,798
But this morning you said,
"I love this."

612
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:08,322
Remember "Best morning ever"?

613
00:27:08,365 --> 00:27:09,889
I... I did, I do.

614
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,847
I just...
I appreciate all the stuff

615
00:27:11,891 --> 00:27:13,457
you're doing to make me happy.

616
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,851
But I love lots of things.

617
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,461
I love...

618
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,289
stupid buddy comedies

619
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,508
and Taylor Swift,

620
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,032
and quiet nights,

621
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,686
and poetry,

622
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,776
and just spending time
with you.

623
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,473
I love that, too.

624
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,084
So you'll chill on the food?

625
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:32,128
Indeed.

626
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,435
But just to be clear,

627
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:36,655
chill doesn't mean
you want gelato

628
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,745
or a nice chilled
shrimp cocktail, correct?

629
00:27:39,788 --> 00:27:42,138
No more food. Hot or cold.

630
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,190
I'm sorry about
your brother.

631
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:51,582
Here.

632
00:27:51,626 --> 00:27:53,410
Thank you.

633
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,892
Knowing now
that I am tied to someone

634
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:59,112
who betrayed my people
so violently

635
00:27:59,155 --> 00:28:01,114
is, uh, unsettling.

636
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:03,899
And it makes me worry.

637
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,640
If this memory
was taken from me,

638
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,642
what else might I not know
about myself,

639
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,730
good or bad?

640
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,036
Well, you have us,

641
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:11,690
and we know you.

642
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,300
Thank you.

643
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:15,563
And I appreciate you
letting me be here.

644
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:16,825
But shouldn't you be working?

645
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,914
Oh, please.
You are a welcome distraction.

646
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,699
Andrea is gunning for me,

647
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:22,875
and that William guy...

648
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,398
I mean,
who does he think he is?

649
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,053
I caught him following me.

650
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:28,750
Following you?

651
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:29,751
Did you confront him?

652
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,448
No. I couldn't.
I was Supergirl.

653
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:35,539
But he is sneaky.

654
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,585
And I think
he's trying to sabotage me.

655
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:38,934
He just rattles
around the office

656
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:41,545
with his smug
British accent. And...

657
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:43,069
You know who I feel bad for?

658
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:43,983
His wife,

659
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:45,462
'cause she's stuck with him.

660
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,683
J'onn, I don't know
how much longer

661
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,119
I can last at CatCo.

662
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:53,775
The Kara Danvers I know
is not a quitter.

663
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,211
If someone's trying to
sabotage you,

664
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,691
you just ignore them.

665
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,127
They're spending
all their energy on you,

666
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,434
you spend yours
on being the best you.

667
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:22,412
Kelly? Hey!

668
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,763
Did I leave the door unlocked?

669
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:26,155
Yep.

670
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,417
Oh, geez.

671
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,810
Uh, I'm gonna put on
a sweater real quick.

672
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:29,942
You open the wine.

673
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,992
To a successful day.

674
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:39,299
Ugh.
To an exhausting day.

675
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:44,826
And, um...

676
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,787
Thank you so much
for helping J'onn.

677
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,963
You really are
a miracle worker.

678
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,878
It was nothing.

679
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:55,184
You're the real hero.

680
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,969
Almost catching
J'onn's brother.

681
00:29:58,318 --> 00:30:01,669
I feel like I barely understand
what you guys do.

682
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,802
How did you
manage to track him?

683
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,284
You know what...

684
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,897
Let's not order in.

685
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,072
I still have some of that

686
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:14,595
blueberry pancakes batter
in the fridge,

687
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,292
so how about I whip
some of those up?

688
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:18,425
Sounds good.

689
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,521
You're not my girlfriend.

690
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:30,611
You killed my comrade.

691
00:30:33,005 --> 00:30:35,007
-It's Alex.

692
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,183
She's in trouble.

693
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,015
We gotta go.

694
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,538
Alex?

695
00:30:53,068 --> 00:30:54,548
Hey, I got your signal.

696
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:55,941
Is everything okay?

697
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,856
Yeah, I'm fine.

698
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,553
Oh, I must have just bumped it.

699
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,298
What did you do with Alex?

700
00:31:05,602 --> 00:31:06,865
Oh...

701
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,997
Humans are so fragile,
aren't they?

702
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:18,267
That wasn't very nice.

703
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:50,082
I got this.
You go get my brother.

704
00:32:01,397 --> 00:32:02,964
I'm going to help those people.

705
00:32:04,313 --> 00:32:06,054
Why are Alex
and Supergirl fighting?

706
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:07,969
That's not Alex,
that's my brother.

707
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,449
Alex may still be inside.

708
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:11,016
I'm gonna go find her.

709
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,669
- Move,
move, move, move!

710
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,323
Let's go! Let's go!

711
00:32:14,715 --> 00:32:15,716
Alex?

712
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:18,197
Alex?

713
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,550
Alex, wake up.

714
00:32:23,593 --> 00:32:25,160
-Wake up, Alex.

715
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,684
-Don't touch me.
-Hey, it's me. It's me.

716
00:32:30,818 --> 00:32:32,037
It's you. Okay.

717
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,300
It's you.

718
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:36,128
Okay.

719
00:32:36,171 --> 00:32:37,433
We have to get out of here.

720
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:39,000
We gotta go.

721
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:41,220
Okay.

722
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:42,786
Wait. There's a fire
in the stairwell.

723
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,918
I barely made it up here.

724
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,485
Okay. We can get out
through the roof.

725
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,052
Okay, go.

726
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:49,968
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

727
00:33:21,086 --> 00:33:22,478
Alex, it's me.

728
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,350
Alex, listen to me.

729
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:27,135
Just hold us both here
until help comes.

730
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:28,745
No. He's just trying to escape.

731
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:31,661
Shoot him.

732
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:39,147
No!

733
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:40,757
No.

734
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:55,859
Well, the building's all right.

735
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,296
Everything's sound.

736
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:59,472
But I can't speak
for your reputation

737
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:00,734
with your neighbors

738
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:03,563
or Mr. Nelson's
melted pint of Rocky Road.

739
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,391
So, that was your brother,

740
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,392
the traitor?

741
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:07,436
Yes.

742
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,047
I'm afraid
this is far from over.

743
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:10,831
When our minds were joined,

744
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:13,442
Malefic said
I was still in the dark.

745
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:16,663
Perhaps if I could access
more of my memories,

746
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:19,405
I might be able to uncover
what his next move will be.

747
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,712
Kelly, do you think
we could go deeper

748
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:23,931
with Obsidian's tech?

749
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:27,239
Perhaps turn the energy
up to 80 biohertz?

750
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:29,545
That kind of power
could reset your brain

751
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:30,590
for good.

752
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,635
We can't take that chance.

753
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:35,116
All right.

754
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:46,127
William?

755
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,042
You're here late.

756
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,565
Working on a new
extracurricular story?

757
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,611
No. Actually, I'm just here
to do my job.

758
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,093
That's a nice change.

759
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,445
You know what?

760
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,576
I see you.

761
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,144
You're a saboteur.

762
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,320
You bring other people down
to make you look better.

763
00:35:05,364 --> 00:35:07,279
And maybe that's how
you've made it this far,

764
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:09,933
but that's a rotten way
of making it to the top.

765
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,674
So you can try
to get me in trouble

766
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,111
and steal my stories,

767
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,938
but while you're busy plotting
and undermining me,

768
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:18,246
I'm going to be doing my job,
with heart and integrity,

769
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,682
and I'm gonna be doing it well.

770
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:29,127
Nothing says sorry
for the terror like cookies.

771
00:35:30,606 --> 00:35:31,390
Oh, hey,

772
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:33,305
I got you a little gift.

773
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:35,133
Oh!

774
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,613
So this
is the list of my allergies.

775
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:39,876
Blueberries, hazelnuts,
bees, and cats.

776
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,271
This is very helpful.
Thank you.

777
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:44,838
You're welcome.

778
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:46,100
You know, I...

779
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,234
I realized that my spiral

780
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,626
this morning
about the blueberries

781
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,977
wasn't really about
the blueberries.

782
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,153
What do you mean?

783
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,198
We haven't been together
for very long,

784
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:59,157
so, you know,
it just made me realize

785
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,377
how much we still don't know
about each other.

786
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:05,032
And, you know, I really

787
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:08,166
frickin' like you like a lot.

788
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,993
And so...

789
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:11,386
That scared me.

790
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,127
Alex, you're safe with me.

791
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,824
I know that now.

792
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:17,349
Earlier when I...
When I touched her hand,

793
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:20,178
I knew that wasn't you.

794
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:22,180
Because you can't fake
how that feels.

795
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:25,139
Just like you can't fake
being who you are.

796
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,359
So, on that rooftop,

797
00:36:28,316 --> 00:36:31,232
when you made
that very selfless choice,

798
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:34,017
I knew exactly in that moment

799
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:36,194
which one of you was my Kelly.

800
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,673
And I might not know

801
00:36:37,717 --> 00:36:40,241
every little detail
about you yet,

802
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:42,678
but I know you.

803
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,289
Aw!

804
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:46,639
-So sweet.
-Isn't it?

805
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:02,263
- Dearest, Nia...

806
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:07,355
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?"

807
00:37:07,964 --> 00:37:09,401
Brainy, wha...

808
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,926
Why are you doing all this?

809
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:15,189
Nia, I heard you
loud and clear.

810
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,323
From now on I will shower you
with poetry.

811
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:19,889
Oh!

812
00:37:19,933 --> 00:37:21,891
Have no fear.

813
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:25,504
Even without spicy tuna,
I will venture to make each day

814
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,333
the best day ever.

815
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:31,423
Which is theoretically
impossible.

816
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:32,772
But...

817
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:37,603
you make me want to do
the impossible.

818
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,649
Brainy you are

819
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,303
adorable.

820
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,959
But sometimes
you are the dumbest

821
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:47,613
smartest person I know.

822
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:50,746
Thank you.

823
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,583
Eve, I've decided
that it's time

824
00:38:01,627 --> 00:38:03,368
to fill you in on
what I've been doing.

825
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,770
You will not
regret this, Ms. Luthor.

826
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:16,076
You can count on me.

827
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:17,469
For real this time.

828
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,688
I must admit, I had my doubts.

829
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,561
But now I know that

830
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:24,302
there are aspects
of your brain that I need.

831
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,042
And now that I know
that I can trust you,

832
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:28,436
I believe you and I
are going to do

833
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,655
great things together.

834
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,354
Eve,

835
00:38:34,094 --> 00:38:35,965
meet Hope.

836
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:37,967
You two are going to be
working closely together.

837
00:38:39,665 --> 00:38:40,666
How so?

838
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:43,843
Well, first, Eve,

839
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,235
we need to evolve you,

840
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,412
and you yourself said that
you wanted to be better.

841
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:49,501
I promise you,
you will not feel a thing.

842
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:55,724
You've been mapping my mind?

843
00:38:55,768 --> 00:38:57,552
I needed to locate
and highlight

844
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:58,597
the centers of your brain

845
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,338
that trigger
honesty and loyalty.

846
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,861
Why?

847
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,516
So Hope knows where to go.

848
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:28,366
"I didn't develop
a sense of smell
until the tender age of 14."

849
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:58,961
Kara, have you finished
editing, yet?

850
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,485
I have.

851
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,748
I also sent you 11 pitches
ahead of tomorrow's meeting,

852
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,446
all with eye-grabbing headlines
and image options.

853
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:07,796
Well,

854
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:10,930
I look forward
to discussing them tomorrow.

855
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:12,888
Don't be late.

856
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,454
Without the powers
that were stolen from me

857
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,020
in the Phantom Zone,

858
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,544
the power to incept,

859
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,937
there's no way I can defeat
my brother and his friends.

860
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:03,852
You listen,
but you do not hear.

861
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:05,898
That woman gave you the answer.

862
00:41:07,029 --> 00:41:07,987
That kind of power

863
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,510
could reset your brain
for good.

864
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,078
Reset your brain.

865
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,123
Reset your brain.

866
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:27,528
Hope?

867
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:29,574
Good morning, Ms. Luthor.

868
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:31,358
Since Andrea Rojas
took my lenses,

869
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:32,968
we need a new plan.

870
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:34,535
Luckily she confirmed
my hypothesis

871
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:36,537
about the interworking
of her technology.

872
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,670
This pleases you.

873
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:40,976
We don't need Andrea's tech.

874
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,675
With your help,
I can build my own.

875
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,678
And together
we can rebuild humanity.
