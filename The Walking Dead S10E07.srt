00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,871
Siddiq: Cheryl?
Cheryl, here.

00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:47,264

00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,302
We need the cell.

31
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:58,499
You know him?

32
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:01,023
He's one that watches
the Guardians.

33
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:02,372
I mean,
the walkers.

34
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:06,071
So he knows
where your mother's horde is?

35
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:08,160
Probably.

36
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:11,207
You've put us all at risk.We have to find that horde

37
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,209
before it shows up
at our gates.

38
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,819
So you decide for all of us?

39
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,256
Knowing what it could mean?

40
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,648
Doesn't matter anymore.

41
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:21,391
We still gotta find them.

42
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:26,875
I'm gonna be
in there with you,

43
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:29,094
and Siddiq is gonna treat
his wounds first.

44
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,444
He bleeds
until he answers.

45
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,403
That's not your call.
None of this is.

46
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:34,752
You did what you did,

47
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,493
but I'm not gonna let it go
from bad to worse,

48
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:38,234
and I think the council
would agree.

49
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,192
Including Michonne.

50
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:48,375
Come on.
You can stay with me.

51
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:00,256
You can go on up.

52
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,391
Thanks for having my back
with Gabriel.

53
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,394
It's just the truth.

54
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:10,179
The Whisperer's not gonnagive it up easy.

55
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:12,181
If you wanna sit this out,I get it.

56
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,638
Whoa-ho-ho!

57
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:36,379
Down, boy.

58
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,036
Yeah, good boy.

59
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:48,086
Come on.

60
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,415
It's still yours.

61
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:17,333
This'll help
with the bruises.

62
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,900
I had worse.

63
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,685
Me, too.

64
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:27,125
The Whisperer, what else
do you know about him?

65
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,476
Only thathe won't betray my mom.

66
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,131
The ones that watch the horde
are loyal.

67
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,612
She gives them
no choice.

68
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,875
Neither will I.

69
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,616
What else?

70
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,577
People will die,
right?

71
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:48,756
I hate them.

72
00:06:50,975 --> 00:06:52,890
But I know them, too.

73
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:56,024
Alpha drew a line,

74
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,940
and you need to choose
which side you're on.

75
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:04,119
I wish I'd left with Henrywhen he asked.

76
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,474
So do I.

77
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,870
My mom twists people.

78
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:22,529
Gets them to do
what she wants.

79
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:25,662
Makes them thinkit's what they want.

80
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:29,927
People obey 'cause they thinkthey have no other choice.

81
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,891
But if
you let him see...

82
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:39,546
what you have here,

83
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:46,596
that a place like thiscan survive...

84
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,296
An idea like that
is dangerous.

85
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,821
It would spread.

86
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:03,831
And there's nothing
my mom could do to stop it.

87
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,457
Don't try anything.

88
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,938
Never.

89
00:08:29,247 --> 00:08:32,033
He's gonna
need stitches.

90
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,862
I know you.

91
00:08:37,081 --> 00:08:39,649
Look.

92
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:49,485
Dante can take it
from here.

93
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,269
I'm fine.

94
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:53,010
I'm fine.

95
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:54,664
Outside.

96
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,361
Now.

97
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,433
Look.

98
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,858
You have bread
every day.

99
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,643
Yeah.

100
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,733
Made fresh this morning.

101
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:06,823
Got some extra,
if you'd like.

102
00:10:08,825 --> 00:10:12,133
How do your people
make so much?

103
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,569
With flour.

104
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,572
But...every day?

105
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,749
Seems like a lot of peopledoing just that.

106
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:22,665
As many as needed.

107
00:10:28,584 --> 00:10:31,761
Oh.

108
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,721
From my daughter.

109
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,205
You have children?

110
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,859
Just the one.

111
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,601
About all I can handle.

112
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,690
And there are more?

113
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,607
There are.

114
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,001
Do you...?

115
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,394
Children hold you back.

116
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,744
Make you weak.

117
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,616
What about a family,
then?

118
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,271
Brothers or sisters?

119
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,409
I'm an only child.

120
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:33,736
Let's get started.

121
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,835
So,
what's it gonna be?

122
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:48,055
Honey or jam?

123
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:51,972
Strawberry or apple?

124
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,806
All of it.

125
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,330
Not a problem.

126
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:06,334
We have plenty here.

127
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:16,953
For lunch,
I was thinking salted fish.

128
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:22,480
I like to wrap 'em up
in a fresh piece of lettuce,

129
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:24,091
add a little --

130
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,571
What do you want?

131
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:29,400
Well, right now,
we're just gonna talk.

132
00:12:29,444 --> 00:12:32,055
Pass.

133
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:35,145
Okay.

134
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:40,934
Then, eat.

135
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:21,801
Good?

136
00:13:31,114 --> 00:13:33,769
No.

137
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,907
You okay?

138
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,648
Yeah.

139
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:46,086
Am I okay?

140
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,000
Yep.

141
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,045
Nice and pasty.

142
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,744
Still look good,
though.

143
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,094
Damn right.

144
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,574
I mean,
if it weren't for Gabriel,

145
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,881
I would be
making my move.

146
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,927
Don't let that
stop you.

147
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,668
Man doesn't havea jealous bone in him.

148
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,845
Oh, yeah?

149
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,803
Okay,
scoot over.

150
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,208
I've been thinking...

151
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:22,600
Mm-hmm.

152
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:24,994
...about Eugene.

153
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,823
Sorry.

154
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,218
It's your other
other man.

155
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,263
Yeah.

156
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:37,006
We set a date to talk,and I missed it.

157
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,617
I justdon't want him to think

158
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:41,881
that I was dissing him
or anything.

159
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,972
He'll be fine.

160
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:51,847
That guy,
he bounces back.

161
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,937
Not everybody does.

162
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,594
I did, uh, check out
a few of his baby tips.

163
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,859
The poop chart --
that shit was on point.

164
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,992
I mean, literally.

165
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:09,430
Eugene is
a bona fide shit-ologist.

166
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:18,047
We have a kid together,
Mami.

167
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,920
Yes, we do.

168
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:26,838
I didn't think I'd be a mamiin this world.

169
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,971
Try not
to think about it.

170
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:31,582
Freaks me out
every time.

171
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,454
I just...

172
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,978
wanna do it right.

173
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:39,112
Wanna be a good dad.

174
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,638
Freaks me outthat you're a dad, too.

175
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,685
Thanks.

176
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:53,474
No,she's lucky to have you.

177
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,693
We both are.

178
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,314
Here, sit up, sit up.

179
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:20,196
Okay?
Yeah.

180
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,725
You okay?

181
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:30,032
Yeah.

182
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,339
Just got
a lot of patients to see

183
00:16:32,382 --> 00:16:35,951
and miles to go
before I sleep.

184
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,909
Okay, come on.

185
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,488
Where's the horde?

186
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,285
Tell me.

187
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:09,985
Lady,you have the animal in you.

188
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,206
If we were out there,

189
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:16,992
I would take youlike a bitch in heat.

190
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,359
Unh!

191
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:50,330
That's enough.

192
00:17:57,163 --> 00:18:00,035
You're all weak.

193
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:12,265
Gonna start
with your fingers first.

194
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,180
Then both your ears.

195
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:17,183
Then we'll take
all your teeth.

196
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:20,360
You lie to yourselves.

197
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:25,452
To each other.

198
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:28,411
You fight for what?

199
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,196
Sandwiches?

200
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:35,201
You ignore the truth

201
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:39,683
when it's staring youin the face.

202
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:43,252
I would never
betray Alpha.

203
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:45,385
She rescued me.

204
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,648
She protects me.

205
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:50,172
She loves me.

206
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,262
She loves us all.

207
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:58,267
She sacrificedher own daughter for us.

208
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,490
She killed Lydia?

209
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:04,882
Oh.

210
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,671
She did.

211
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,891
And I am willing

212
00:19:13,935 --> 00:19:17,068
to give my life
for her.

213
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,558
Stop.

214
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:31,126
This ends now.

215
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,389
You're not getting Lydia
mixed up in this.

216
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:36,131
He swallowed every ounceof Alpha's bullshit.

217
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,437
Every ounce.

218
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,048
If he seesthat Lydia's alive and well,

219
00:19:40,091 --> 00:19:42,355
gets it that his great leader
lied to him,

220
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:45,140
then maybe
that changes something.Please.

221
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,534
That kid's
been through enough.

222
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,321
Let hermake up her own mind.

223
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:55,194
This is the only way,
and you know it.

224
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,680
That good, huh?

225
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:07,206
It's a little better
than last time, yeah.

226
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,950
Know how I know
a man's lying?

227
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,692
His lips are moving.

228
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,176
Cheryl,
you're gonna get through this.

229
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,743
Okay?

230
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:25,963
I'll make sure of it.

231
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:29,271
Sit down, Doc.

232
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,500
You look
worse than I do.

233
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:43,459
Close your peepers.

234
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:45,113
Rest.

235
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,376
Cheryl,
I can't -- I --

236
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,204
Ain't for me.

237
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,599
I made my peace.

238
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,384
But others...

239
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:59,910
need to haveyour head on straight.

240
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:24,631
Go ahead.

241
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:28,504
Yeah.

242
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,775
She's actually
a pretty good rider.

243
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,039
Mostly I think she just
uses it as an excuse

244
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,825
to stay out
with her friends.

245
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,696
Did you ever ride?

246
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,524
Sometimes.

247
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,047
Yeah,
I couldn't get enough.

248
00:21:50,091 --> 00:21:53,181
Find every excuseto stay out as long as I could,

249
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:56,619
keep going, even if it was just
up and down our street.

250
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:58,404
As kids,
we'd always try

251
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:01,320
to take the long way homearound the lake.

252
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,370
Brother or sister?

253
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:13,680
I'm sorry.
I...

254
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,030
I had a brother.

255
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:19,686
Yeah, he was a couple years
younger than me.

256
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,122
He, uh...

257
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,473
He loved cars.

258
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:27,476
Only thing he loved
more than cars was people.

259
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,524
And...they loved him.

260
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:35,571
And I still think about him
every day.

261
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,313
You know,
I know what it's like

262
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,793
to lose someone
that you love that much,

263
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:43,318
and I know that it helps
to talk about it.

264
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,494
What you're doing...

265
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,540
these questions...

266
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,413
you know,
digging for intel...

267
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,461
I suppose I should be
doing the same,

268
00:22:55,504 --> 00:22:57,506
but what's the point?

269
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:01,684
So maybe we just...

270
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:05,862
talk about nothing
worth reporting, you know?

271
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:08,430
You know, I can go on and on
about my brother,

272
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,171
and maybe you can --

273
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,567
We walk in darkness,we are free.

274
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,004
We bathe in blood,
we are free...

275
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,441
Whisperer: We walk in darkness,we are free.

276
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,182
We bathe in blood,
we are free...

277
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:22,531
Gabriel:
I don't know.

278
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:24,533
We came back,
and he was shaking in pain.

279
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,407
We walk in darkness...

280
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,800
Put your healin' hands on me,
Doc.

281
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,236
I'm burning up here.

282
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,499
What's the problem?

283
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:34,935
How the hell
should I know?!

284
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,633
Just make it stop!

285
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,461
I'm on this,
Jefe.
No. Come on.

286
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:41,507
All right,
his breathing's labored.

287
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,639
Pupils dilated,
his muscles are convulsing,

288
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:45,032
but no signs
of infection.

289
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,381
It doesn't make sense.

290
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,470
Hey, hey!
Easy!

291
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:50,820
Hold him!

292
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:54,563
Look, Dante, in my bag,grab the red bark!

293
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:57,044
Red bark!

294
00:23:57,087 --> 00:23:59,568
Easy.
Hey, hey, easy.

295
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,178
Easy, easy.

296
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:02,615
Hey.

297
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,666
No, Carol.

298
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,377
This morning...

299
00:24:26,421 --> 00:24:28,423
Did you
give this to him?

300
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,600
Yeah,
for pain and inflammation.

301
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:34,429
You killed him.

302
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,129
How?

303
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,437
No, that's yarrow.

304
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,919
It's hemlock.

305
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,443
I -- I didn't know.

306
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,966
I -- I didn't know.

307
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,315
I thought, uh --

308
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:54,188
What?
You thought what?

309
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:57,321
I never thought hemlock would bein the bag because, um...

310
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,410
Because what,
Dante?

311
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:04,677
Because you packed it.

312
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:49,156
One less Guardian
for our horde.

313
00:25:56,816 --> 00:26:00,776
The man
with the metal arm?

314
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,300
Aaron.

315
00:26:03,344 --> 00:26:06,608
He has a daughter.

316
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,742
Is that
all you've learned?

317
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:15,530
Did you ask...

318
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,315
after your sister's child?

319
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:21,536
There is nothing
to ask.

320
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,756
He is one of them.

321
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:26,933
He will slaughter
our kind.

322
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:30,850
He will search out
your weaknesses.

323
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:34,244
He will use your sisteragainst you.

324
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:40,250
Remove your mask.

325
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,541
We are always
being tested.

326
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,459
We must remain strong.

327
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:30,779
I believe in you.

328
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:33,390
Never doubt that.

329
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,963
You are my Gamma.

330
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:45,402
Tell me.

331
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:48,754
This Aaron...

332
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:54,194
he tempts you
with his lies.

333
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:57,066
Do not be seduced.

334
00:28:06,989 --> 00:28:11,037
Gabriel: If people find out,they'll panic.

335
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,214
If Alpha finds out...

336
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,912
She won't.

337
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:22,222
I'll clean up
the mess.

338
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:23,832
I'll help.

339
00:28:23,876 --> 00:28:26,792
'Cause it's not your messto clean.

340
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,495
Lydia: We're not going hunting,are we?

341
00:28:34,538 --> 00:28:37,237
You still wanna help?

342
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,673
Yeah.

343
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,631
Good.

344
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:45,462
Cheryl?

345
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,883
Hey.

346
00:29:19,888 --> 00:29:24,719
I was gonna come try to find youbut, uh...

347
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,881
Siddiq: Cheryl, you're gonna get through this.

348
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:57,839
It's hemlock. I'll make sure of it.

349
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,493
You killed him.

350
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:42,362
Open your eyes.

351
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,191
Look.

352
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:54,069
Look.

353
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:56,158
Enid!

354
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:29,888
I heard
what happened.

355
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:34,022
Don't want
to talk about it.

356
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:37,025
Go home.
You should be in bed.

357
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:39,941
No.

358
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,857
Start
or we go back in.

359
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,033
Drown together.

360
00:31:46,078 --> 00:31:47,993
There's nothing to say.

361
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:50,343
He died
because of my --

362
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:51,605
Unh-unh.

363
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:54,608
No,I want the real shit.

364
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:58,438
Whatever's been eating you up
for weeks -- spill.

365
00:32:04,226 --> 00:32:07,664
It's like
I'm still there...

366
00:32:07,708 --> 00:32:08,970
all the time.

367
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:10,885
It's like
I never left.

368
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,974
But it's just pieces.

369
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:15,063
And they're all
jumbled together

370
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:18,284
like a puzzle
or something.

371
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:21,678
The screams and...

372
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:23,985
the smell...

373
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,901
the blood,
everything...

374
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,776
I can't get it
to stop.

375
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,215
People are dying.

376
00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:38,217
Cheryl is already --

377
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,914
Cheryl was sick.

378
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,656
You're doing
everything you can.

379
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:45,398
You're not alone.

380
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,924
You mean Dante?

381
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:58,933
Do you know why
he bothers me so much?

382
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,415
Enid.

383
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:08,464
'Cause when he's there...

384
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:12,033
I just think about
how much I miss her.

385
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,472
But then, I get to remember
how I failed her, so...

386
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:20,085
No.

387
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,305
No,this isn't your fault.

388
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,266
What that skin bitch didain't on you.

389
00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:29,355
You weren't there.

390
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:33,359
Okay? You...

391
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,364
Enid, Tara, the...

392
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:46,154
People that I love
died right in front of me.

393
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:51,072
And now I get to watch it
over and over and over.

394
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:53,248
And I did nothing.

395
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:55,772
I did nothing!

396
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:59,776
I just --
I didn't move.

397
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,388
I didn't help.

398
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:06,392
I just watched.

399
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:10,265
Now, because of me,
more people...

400
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,963
Look, I'm just --
I'm not smart enough.

401
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:15,488
Bullshit.

402
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:18,926
Bullshit.

403
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:22,190
You have to
pull through.

404
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,846
You have to fight it.

405
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:28,501
For Coco.

406
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,024
Me.

407
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,506
And everyone else
that loves you.

408
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:35,769
And you can.

409
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,597
You will.

410
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,557
Because you're not alone.

411
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:44,734
And you're the smartest personI know.

412
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,608
Except me, of course.

413
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:00,446
I still can't figure out
why you're sick.

414
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:08,715
The patients,
you don't live together,

415
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,064
you don't work together,

416
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,198
you don't even eat
the same things.

417
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,984
There's not
a common denominator.

418
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,334
At least not one
that I can...

419
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:22,337
What?

420
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:23,599
Nothing.

421
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,471
Go home, okay?

422
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:27,647
Go home.

423
00:36:09,384 --> 00:36:11,038
Yaah!

424
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,347
Yaah!

425
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,402
No, no.
It's --

426
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:30,492
That's yours now.
A gift.

427
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:33,278
I don't want anythingfrom you.

428
00:36:33,321 --> 00:36:36,803
Take it
or I'll burn it.

429
00:36:46,813 --> 00:36:49,250
All right.

430
00:36:49,294 --> 00:36:51,296
No more games.

431
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:55,604
I ask questions,and you answer, got it?

432
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,171
Don't do this.

433
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,825
This isn't you.

434
00:36:58,868 --> 00:37:00,957
You...

435
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:04,396
have no idea
who I am.

436
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:07,616
Now, how many peopledo you have?

437
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:13,405
Let him go.

438
00:37:13,448 --> 00:37:14,667
Let him go.

439
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,461
No.

440
00:37:26,505 --> 00:37:28,071
No.

441
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,598
No.

442
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:44,305
Your mother told her people
that she killed you.

443
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:52,095
You said
you wanted my help.

444
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,228
I did.

445
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,100
You used me.

446
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,885
Lydia, I'm sorry.

447
00:37:58,928 --> 00:38:00,278
You're just like her.

448
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,890
Lydia...

449
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,288
You said you wanted me
to choose a side?

450
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:11,332
I choose mine.

451
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,552
You can't go out there.

452
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,423
It's too dangerous.

453
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:19,514
You can't stop me.

454
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:25,651
Unh! Aah.

455
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,656
Aaron: Wait.

456
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:33,659
They could be watching.

457
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,018
Dante: Hey.

458
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:31,325
I know it's late,
but I saw the light on --

459
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,806
Leave me alone.

460
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:38,506
Just wanna chat
for sec, Jef.

461
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:41,596
I am not your jef.

462
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:45,861
Sure you are, Chief.

463
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:50,344
Mm.

464
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,478
I'll go, but...

465
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,090
not before
saying sorry.

466
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:59,484
With Eugene gone,
I gotta...

467
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:02,443
pitch in
with the water.

468
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,011
I haven't
pulled my weight.

469
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,926
Stop.

470
00:40:06,969 --> 00:40:10,016
Stop.
This is my fault.

471
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:13,019
It's not yours.

472
00:40:13,062 --> 00:40:15,543
It is not
anyone else's.

473
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:17,371
Yeah.

474
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,418
I know
you want this blame.

475
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:27,120
For a sec, everything else
makes sense, right?

476
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:31,037
Well, I'm sorry, bro --
ain't how it works.

477
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,259
Look,
this place is special.

478
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:39,480
And I got that
right away.

479
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:44,137
It -- It works
'cause it's a village.

480
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,925
It takes everyone here
to build, grow, and fight,

481
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:56,192
raise rug rats
and heal people.

482
00:40:56,236 --> 00:40:59,413
Everyone carries
equal weight.

483
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,204
So, when something happens,
it's all our fault, yeah?

484
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:15,124
And when one of us
is suffering...

485
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:17,475
we're here to help.

486
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:21,000
You don't even
know me, man.

487
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:26,005
Sure do.

488
00:41:26,048 --> 00:41:28,747
You're my friend.

489
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:40,019
It's gonna be okay.

490
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:43,239
Yeah.

491
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:44,893
Yeah.

492
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:57,036
Look.

493
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,134
Enid!

494
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:10,397
Look.

495
00:42:12,094 --> 00:42:14,488
Open your eyes.

496
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:17,970
N-o-o-o!

497
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:20,799
Open your eyes.

498
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,931
Get off!

499
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,116
I didn't want this!

500
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:18,639
Not you!

501
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,902
Not like this.

502
00:43:32,522 --> 00:43:35,351
Close your eyes.

503
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:37,745
Close your eyes.
