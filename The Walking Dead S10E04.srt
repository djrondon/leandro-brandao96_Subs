00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:34,394

135
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,179

Carol's bandages.

136
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:40,182

shot at her.

137
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,445

138
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,926

139
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:48,103
I don't want you
to worry about this.

140
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,409
That's my job,

141
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:51,976
and I happen to be
very good at my job.

142
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,196
Okay.

143
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,764
But I can be
a fresh set of eyes.

144
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,983
Or a pair
of friendly ears?

145
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:07,557
Alpha said
that she would release the horde

146
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,733
if we ever
crossed her border.

147
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:15,130
Carol took a shot at her,
and she only took land.

148
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,613
Maybe their rules
are changing.

149
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,049
Maybe.

150
00:07:21,092 --> 00:07:24,618
But when you start negotiating
with a bully,

151
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:28,752
there may be no end to
how much they try to take.

152
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:31,451
Some bullies
you can live with.

153
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,279
Others,
you gotta fight.

154
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,630
Can we live
with the skins?

155
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:39,110
Well,
theysaid we could.

156
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:42,592
But you never take your enemy
at their word.

157
00:07:42,636 --> 00:07:46,030
You measure them
by their actions.

158
00:07:46,074 --> 00:07:49,207
So, when their actions
are unexpected...

159
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:55,039
You know how when we want RJ
to go to sleep,

160
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,781
the fastest way
is to let him run around?

161
00:07:57,825 --> 00:08:00,044
Right.

162
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:02,046
'Cause then
he'll be so tired

163
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,701
that RJ will
put himself to sleep.

164
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:08,270
Maybe the Whisperers
wanna keep us fighting back

165
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:11,491
until we get so tired
that they have the advantage.

166
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,320
That is not bad,
kiddo.

167
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:18,715
I knew RJ would eventually
be good for something.

168
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:23,154
So, am I right?

169
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:26,723
Is that
the kind of bully they are?

170
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,074
You're thinking on it.

171
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:40,868
Whoa.

172
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,669

You see something?

173
00:09:02,237 --> 00:09:03,891

out here?

175
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:08,112
I don't know.

00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:11,594
You guys keep riding
to Hilltop.

177
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,901
Good luck, Mom.Thanks, baby.

178
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:16,338
I'll be
right behind you.

179
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,614
Whoa. Whoa!

180
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:13,961
Ezekiel?

181
00:10:14,004 --> 00:10:16,964
You should go.

182
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:22,839
Can you step away
from the edge?

183
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,286
Then I'm not
going anywhere.

184
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:01,704
It's okay.

185
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,706
It's okay.

186
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,013
It's okay.

187
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:08,885
It's okay.

188
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,365
It's okay.

189
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:30,820
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:45,356
You looking
for a job, kid?

191
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,967
Just trying
to clear my head.

192
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,969
It's your third visit
in a week.

193
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,361
You keep it up,

194
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,798
you're gonna find some socks
with your name on 'em.

195
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:55,845
Gage and his friends
started again today.

196
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,717
Again?

197
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,153
Jesus.

198
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,024
Alright, kid, look,
obviously you're having a day,

199
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:04,332
but, you know, what happened to
rolling with it?

200
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,987
I'm not just
gonna smile and take it.

201
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,075
I didn't say that.

202
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:09,903
But I also didn't say
run and hide.

203
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,165
I mean, shit.

204
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,297
You said to
kill 'em with kindness.

205
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:15,082
I did say that.

206
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:18,128
Look, they are trying
to get a reaction out of you.

207
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,739
They wanna
see you upset.

208
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,784
Don't give that to 'em.
Screw 'em.

209
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:25,005
Let's go.

210
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,789
I'm good.

211
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,444
Now.

212
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,103
She is just trying
to fit in.

213
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:37,582
Yeah.

214
00:12:37,626 --> 00:12:38,932
Well, that ain't ever
gonna happen

215
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,586
if she hangs out
with you, now, is it?

216
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:47,767
We were just talking.

217
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,943
He ain't your friend.

218
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,335
He gets me.

219
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:54,295
Just stay away
from him, alright?

220
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,357
You know
I didn't mean to --

221
00:13:13,401 --> 00:13:16,012
We never would've
worked out anyway.

222
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,885
Both too damn stubborn.

223
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:25,848
Maybe in
another universe.

224
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:27,850
Mm.

225
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,818
I lost my Kingdom.

226
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,822
I had a reign,
and what did I do with it?

227
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,347
I failed.

228
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,525
Benjamin, Shiva, Henry,

229
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:54,137
then the Kingdom,
now Hilltop.

230
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:56,923
And Carol.

231
00:14:01,188 --> 00:14:04,931
I don't even know
how to talk to her anymore.

232
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,203
I didn't know
what I was gonna do

233
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:18,945
when I came out here.

234
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:26,953
I've been here before.

235
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,346
Not here...

236
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,089
but here.

237
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:39,791
A long time ago,
when I was on my own,

238
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:43,578
I was in
a dark place.

239
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:46,886
And I started
to envy walkers.

240
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:49,714
Every time
I ran into one,

241
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:53,980
I'd tell myself,
"I'm gonna let it bite me."

242
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:56,939
Next thing I know,

243
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,898
my sword
was chopping off its head

244
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,857
like it has a damn
mind of its own.

245
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,686
So I put the sword down,

246
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,471
kill 'em
with my own bare hands.

247
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:12,259
Eventually...

248
00:15:12,302 --> 00:15:14,870
I just gave up.

249
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,091
And what
that feel like?

250
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:24,140
It feels like
a mask...

251
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:26,490
until it doesn't.

252
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,276
My old mask
saved my life.

253
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,017
But I could only wear it
for so long.

254
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,322
Mm.

255
00:15:32,366 --> 00:15:34,716
Just like that,

256
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,893
you lose it all,
all over again.

257
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,590
Hmm.

258
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:42,115
And somehow...

259
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:48,121
it's harder
the second time around...

260
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:53,256
especially when you get used to
having someone there...

261
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,740
that...
partner in crime...

262
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:03,353
that sounding board...

263
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,965
that walk.

264
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:17,715
Now it's all on you...

265
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,675
just you.

266
00:16:26,594 --> 00:16:29,205
Yet I smile.

267
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,426
For what it's worth,

268
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,950
you're not
a half-bad kisser.

269
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,778
I was a mess.

270
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,562
That was not
the top of my game,

271
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,999
just so you know.

272
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,783
Well, I haven't kissed anyone
over four feet

273
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:45,091
in the last six years,
so...

274
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,137
Listen.

275
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,361
The next time
that you --

276
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,058
Act like an idiot?

277
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:02,282
Just promise me you won't
ride out by yourself again.

278
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:05,720
Thank you, Michonne.

279
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:08,070
Yumiko: How many left?

280
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,550
Jerry: Three.
I'm going back in.

281
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,769
I'll go with you.

282
00:17:11,813 --> 00:17:13,162
Jesus.

283
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,035
There's more of them
out there.

284
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,037
Well,
that's not good.

285
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,256
Will it hold?Alden: Barely.

286
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,344
Walkers keep
pushing in,

287
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:23,085
it's gonna bring
the whole tree down.

288
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,956
Might bring the whole damn
barn down with it.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,175
We got anything
to brace it with?

290
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:28,090
We got some timbers
up at the house.

291
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,179
How much time
before it comes down?

292
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:31,746
How much time?

293
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,313
Enough, I hope.

294
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,144
Uh, guys?

295
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,103
We'll take the walkers.

296
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,373
Alfred:
It's not happening.

297
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,636
Gage: No.
Not at all.

298
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,203
Tastes good to me --

299
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,076
Give us some room,
please?

300
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,133
Oh, my God,
what is wrong with you?

301
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,656
You're crazy!

302
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:20,099
Is this
why Ozzie and Alek died?

303
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,883
So she could
make a fool out of us?

304
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,626
Not here.

305
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,891
Shh.

306
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:40,293
You do wanna
live here, right?

307
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,731
They deserved it.

308
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,124
I know.

309
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:48,083
But you can't be doing
shit like that.

310
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,345
But they can just

311
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:51,391
write whatever the hell
they want on our door?

312
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:54,437
I'll talk to 'em.
I'll set 'em straight.

313
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:55,786
No, please.

314
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,095
I don't want you
to fight my fights for me, okay?

315
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,879
They want me to give up.
I know that.

316
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,142
But I'm not gonna,
okay?

317
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,926
I can't.
I get it.

318
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,102
Can't you just
avoid 'em?

319
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:18,940
Great.

320
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:32,997
Shh.

321
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,568
Ugh!

322
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:39,613
Why do you hate me?

323
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,963
You put my friends
on spikes.

324
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,356
I wasn't there.

325
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:44,531
Ugh!

326
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:48,187
Ozzie was always
a fair man.

327
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,363
So in his honor,

328
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:53,453
I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

329
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,237
If you run away now,

330
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:58,588
we'll play dumb
when they ask us.

331
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,808
This is my home.

332
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:03,158
You're my people.

333
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,295
Get in there, kid!Ozzie was
my best friend!

334
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:10,513
What about
your friend Addy?

335
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:13,777
Get up! Get up!And Rodney?

336
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:15,605
Aah!
Come on!

337
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:18,391
Come on!

338
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:21,176
I loved Henry.
You know I loved him. Please.

339
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,786
Please.

340
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:24,571
Ugh!

341
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,488
Get off me!

342
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:29,924
Ugh! Ohh!

343
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,366
Hold her down.

344
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,020
Get her.

345
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,285
Ohh!

346
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,774
Hey, hey, hey.

347
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:56,646
It's okay.

348
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:01,085
We were just
trying to scare her.

349
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:02,304
Brandon:
Yo, Negan!

350
00:21:02,348 --> 00:21:04,437
What the hell's going on
back here?

351
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,699
Holy shit.
Margo.

352
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,570
Margo.

353
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,060
Shit.

354
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:29,157
Man: Should have never
let 'em out.

355
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,898
Man #2: Yeah, man,
just heard...
You freak.

356
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,422
This is your fault!It was Negan!
Negan killed her!

357
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,381
Lydia:  No, he didn't
do anything wrong.

358
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,383
No, it wasn't --
He didn't do anything.

359
00:21:37,426 --> 00:21:38,732
Now get him
out of here!Please.

360
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,560
Move!
No, he didn't
do anything wrong!

361
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:42,039
I know. I know.
I know. I know. I know.

362
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,303
He didn't
do anything wrong.

363
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,827
No, please!
Oh, please, no.

364
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,351
Please.

365
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,136
Hold that
right there.

366
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:36,920
Easy, now.

367
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:38,748
Hey.

368
00:22:41,577 --> 00:22:43,318
Okay.

369
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,755
All good?

370
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:48,454
I'll be back.

371
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:55,461
I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

372
00:22:59,203 --> 00:23:00,553
Lydia.

373
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,994
He was so sweaty.

374
00:23:07,037 --> 00:23:10,432
Never liked deodorant.

375
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:15,785
Said it --
it made his armpits itchy.

376
00:23:15,829 --> 00:23:18,658
So I got used to it.

377
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:24,359
Sometimes he smelled like
garlic and onions.

378
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:29,408
I miss him.

379
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:32,062
Who's that?

380
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,676
My dad.

381
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:43,160
My dad
would've protected me.

382
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:54,084
Tell me what happened.

383
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:59,612
Negan saved my life.

384
00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:19,719
Man:
...on the wall there.

385
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:22,678
Negan:
How's the kid doing?

386
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:26,639
She's banged up,
but she'll be alright.

387
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,772
You know,
the people out there

388
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,861
are talkin' about
puttin' you down,

389
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:34,690
sayin' Rick ain't around
to save you no more,

390
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,911
maybe they should have done it
a long time ago.

391
00:24:39,216 --> 00:24:44,483
If you came here looking
for a confession...

392
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,963
just keep walking.

393
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:49,575
It was an accident.

394
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:52,795
And for the record,
screw her.

395
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,712
She was a goddamn asshole
beating on a kid.

396
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,714
World's better off.

397
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,762
But you already know that,
don't you?

398
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,679
You came down here
to look me in the eye

399
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,985
because you don't know
what to do with me.

400
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:13,686
Shit, all that time you spent
fantasizing about my death,

401
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:16,427
all that time
you actually tried to kill me,

402
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:17,777
and now look at you.

403
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:21,781
You're not so sure.

404
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:25,611
You listen to me
real close.

405
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:29,440
You and I ain't never
been in a room before,

406
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:30,746
not toe to toe.

407
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,707
And there ain't nobody
to save you right now.

408
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,014
What do you want me to do,
Daryl?

409
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,104
I mean,
the people out there --

410
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,671
they are out
for blood.

411
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:43,846
Guys like you and me --

412
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:46,936
we can smell that
from a mile away.

413
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,504
Why help Lydia?

414
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,941
You ain't no hero.

415
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:55,205
No.
No, I'm not.

416
00:25:55,249 --> 00:25:57,294
I'm a sucker.

417
00:25:57,338 --> 00:26:00,733
See, I started believing in
your way of life,

418
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:03,083
your moral code.

419
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,694
Hell, you even gave me
a little taste of freedom,

420
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,566
just so
you could yank it away

421
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:10,090
when I actually did
the right thing.

422
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:13,528
You gotta admit,
that is pretty messed up.

423
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,660
And we both know

424
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,793
I appreciate
some messed-up shit.

425
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:21,580
You're gonna get your chance
to tell your side.

426
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:26,541
Who's the sucker now?

427
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,501
Daryl: Hey.

428
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,634
Carol: Hey.

429
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,550
How you feelin'?

430
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,899
Sore.

431
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,858
I bet.

432
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:41,121
I heard
what happened.

433
00:26:41,164 --> 00:26:43,602
Yeah.

434
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:46,300
It's a mess.

435
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,086
Everybody's talking about
Negan again.

436
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:55,091
It's like
time never moves.

437
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:59,400
What do you think?

438
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:02,272
I don't give a shit
about him.

439
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:06,407
I believe her,
though.

440
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,888
I do.

441
00:27:10,977 --> 00:27:13,196
This is
a distraction.

442
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,678
Hilltop's got a tree
through its walls.

443
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:18,767
Alexandria was attacked.

444
00:27:18,811 --> 00:27:22,118
Oh, we don't
know that yet.

445
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:27,297
Our real enemy
is out there.

446
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:31,824
There's enough
bad stuff happening here.

447
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:34,696
I'm afraid
if we don't fix it,

448
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,134
it ain't gonna matter
what she does to us.

449
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,269
There won't be
anything left.

450
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:45,228
Should have gone
to New Mexico.

451
00:27:48,318 --> 00:27:50,669
Yeah.

452
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:17,739
Man: Put together
the last one now!

453
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,712
Jerry: Yo!

454
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,104
We got all our peeps!

455
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:36,845
Get back in here!

456
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,066
Alright.
Just keep coming!

457
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:41,545
We got to
get out of here.

458
00:28:41,589 --> 00:28:44,113
Luke!
Magna, let's go!

459
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:48,422
Come on!
We have to
protect the wall!

460
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:53,427
We need help!Yumiko: No,
there's no time.

461
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,733
Hey!

462
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,126
If we stay out here,
we die.

463
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,780
Everybody, let's go!

464
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,913
We've got to
get out of here!

465
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,741
Come on!

466
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,964
Miko!

467
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:26,765
Close the gates!

468
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,724
Come on!
Close them!

469
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:44,870
Defend the breach!

470
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,913
Everything alright?
I've been tryin' to reach you.

471
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:30,089
Rough day,
but things are looking up.

472
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:32,831
What's going on?

473
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:33,919
Something happened.

474
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:36,225
Gabriel:
Lydia lured you there?

475
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:37,966
Gage: Yeah. You saw what she did
with the squirrel.

476
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,968
She's psycho.Alfred: And Negan
was with her.

477
00:30:40,012 --> 00:30:41,752
If you thought
Lydia was crazy,

478
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:45,060
why'd you agree to meet her
back there in the dark?

479
00:30:46,627 --> 00:30:48,368
Well, um...
Well --

480
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,936
Hey, we're the ones
who were attacked here.

481
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,590
But she's the one
laying in the infirmary.

482
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:58,030
And our friend
is in a grave.

483
00:30:58,073 --> 00:30:59,814
Negan's on the right side
this time.

484
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,903
I don't know if it's gonna make
any difference, though.

485
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:04,993
Should I come home?

486
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:09,258
No, not if Hilltop
still needs you.

487
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:15,438
How's Lydia?

488
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:16,875
Not good.

489
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,616
Daryl,
you have to protect her.

490
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,792
Yeah, well,
I'm trying.

491
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,055
No.

492
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:26,623
You have to protect her
for all of us.

493
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,756
When we went
to the border,

494
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,672
we went there
to de-escalate the conflict

495
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,066
and buy time
and strategic advantage.

496
00:31:34,109 --> 00:31:36,982
And it was working
till Carol took her shot.

497
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:40,072
Alpha could have killed us
right there.

498
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:42,074
Why didn't she?

499
00:31:42,117 --> 00:31:44,815
You think she won't attack
if we got Lydia?

500
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,992
Alpha wanted you
to protect her.

501
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:51,083
Look, Lydia's presence
might not help us,

502
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:53,433
but if Alpha thinks
she isn't safe with us

503
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:56,175
or if Lydia runs off
because of all this,

504
00:31:56,218 --> 00:31:57,916
it'll definitely
hurt us.

505
00:31:57,959 --> 00:32:00,179
She has to stay
at Alexandria.

506
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:03,356
Alright.
I'll make sure.

507
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:07,099
Let's just keep this
between us for now.

508
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:13,540
How's RJ?

509
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,107
He's great.

510
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,065
He won't eat
his vegetables,

511
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,328
so I'm a little
afraid for him.

512
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:27,946
Hey, the council's meeting
right now.

513
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,556
Daryl...

514
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,515
I want you to be my proxy
when they vote.

515
00:32:34,561 --> 00:32:36,955
Alright.

516
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,305
I should go.

517
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:42,438
I know you'll do
the right thing.

518
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,494
Rachel:
Oceanside to Hilltop.

519
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:57,105
Come in, Hilltop.
Pick up, please.

520
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:00,152
Hilltop copies.
This is Michonne.

521
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:03,546
Aaron: I get why people might
think Negan's been redeemed.

522
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,375
I've...

523
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,464
I've wondered it myself.

524
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:12,120
Hell, he --
maybe he has changed.

525
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:14,122
But a man like that,

526
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,386
who's done
the things he's done,

527
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,302
killed the people's
he's killed --

528
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:23,044
something inside him
is broken.

529
00:33:23,088 --> 00:33:25,133
We need to face
that fact.

530
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,136
Siddiq: Yes, but killing him now
over this

531
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,183
undermines the civilization
that we have built.

532
00:33:31,226 --> 00:33:34,142
What about the people who
never got to witness that
civilization because of him?

533
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,536
And what the hell
are you even talking about?

534
00:33:36,579 --> 00:33:38,886
The Whisperers
are attacking us.

535
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,410
Okay,
let's take a break.No.
Let me finish.

536
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,369
Look at what's going on
at Hilltop.

537
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:46,067
We're taking our eyes
off the ball.

538
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,156
The council wasn't made
for this,

539
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,159
deciding on a man's life
in the dead of night

540
00:33:51,203 --> 00:33:53,335
because people are carrying
pitchforks and torches.

541
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:56,773
I -- Look,
if you can't make a decision,

542
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:59,124
the people out there
are gonna make one for you.

543
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:02,823
Well,
what'd Michonne say?

544
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:05,130
She wants me
to be her vote.

545
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:09,830
Lydia said Negan saved her,
so he saved her.

546
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:11,484
I'm a "no."

547
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:12,833
So we're tied.

548
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:15,531
Gabriel,
where do you stand?

549
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,195
I'm gonna take the night
to clear my head

550
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,805
and consider my vote,

551
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,720
and I suggest
you all do the same.

552
00:34:32,244 --> 00:34:34,202
Michonne: I'd like to head out
right away,

553
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,378
two wagons,
some supplies.

554
00:34:36,422 --> 00:34:38,946
Yumiko: Rachel's sure
it was them?

555
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:41,209
"Sure" is a strong word,
but she swears

556
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,733
that one of those creepers
were watching them,

557
00:34:43,777 --> 00:34:46,345
too damn close to where
that mask washed up.

558
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:49,739
It might be nothing,
but in case it is one of them,

559
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:52,177
you know as well as I do
they move as a pack.

560
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,613
Where there's one,

561
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:55,876
you can bet your last dollar
there's a hundred more,

562
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,139
much like the order
of Blattodea.

563
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:00,141
Ah, the illustrious
cockroach family.

564
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:05,668
So, you think they're planning
another attack?

565
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:07,279
Walkers at Alexandria,

566
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:10,369
the tree here,
and now Oceanside?

567
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:11,892
First time,
coincidence.

568
00:35:11,935 --> 00:35:13,415
Second time
might be bad luck,

569
00:35:13,459 --> 00:35:15,504
but the third time,
we should check.

570
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,897
Michonne?

571
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,681
Uh, if -- Uh,
if you don't mind,

572
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:21,293
I-I'd love
to join you.

573
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:24,426
I'm feeling the ocean
calling to me.

574
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:29,170
And, um, by "ocean,"
you mean Jules?

575
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:31,912
What are you
talking about?

576
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:33,653
Never even heard of her.Mm-hmm.

577
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:36,525
Oh, yes, of course,
the very tall woman...

578
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:37,657
Yeah.

579
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,876
...with the f-face
and quiet -- Yeah.

580
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,922
Count me in, too.

581
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,445
In that case,
Eugene,

582
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:46,492
you'll need to lead a wagon
back to Alexandria.

583
00:35:46,535 --> 00:35:48,885
Actually,
I'll be staying put.

584
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:51,323
Much like
my amigo here,

585
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:53,281
I feel an energy
calling to me,

586
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,109
urging me on
to help our good neighbors

587
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,025
by employing my expertise
in architecture and engineering

588
00:35:58,068 --> 00:35:59,505
to plug
the metaphorical gap tooth

589
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:01,159
in the
metaphorical smile

590
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:03,422
that is
the Hilltop's fortification.

591
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,339
You want
to fix the wall.

592
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,559
Yes.

593
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:13,127
Fine.

594
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,476
We'll bring back
some supplies

595
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,739
so you can
do it faster.
Apologies.

596
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,306
The only caveat being

597
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,700
that I cannot escort Judith
back to Alexandria.

598
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:21,962
Oh, Judith?

599
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,355
She's coming with me.

600
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,792
I am?
Well, yeah.

601
00:36:25,835 --> 00:36:28,447
Who else is gonna be
my pair of friendly ears?

602
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,629
Man: Yeah.

603
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:39,022
I'll see you later.

604
00:36:39,066 --> 00:36:42,069
Hey.

605
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,505
We did it.

606
00:36:43,549 --> 00:36:46,204
We got everybody out
in time.

607
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,336
We could've have taken
those walkers.

608
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,425
We had a split-second decision
to make --

609
00:36:50,469 --> 00:36:52,993
Youmade the decision.

610
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:56,170
Look,
when shit hits the fan,

611
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,868
somebody's got to
step up.

612
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:00,218
So, yeah,

613
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,003
I -- I listen
to what everybody has to say,

614
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,483
I weigh it all up --

615
00:37:04,526 --> 00:37:07,399
And then you do
what you were gonna do anyway.

616
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:12,317
Where the hell
is all of this coming from?

617
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,756
You're not
my lawyer anymore.

618
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:58,450
Daryl: What?

619
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:00,278
He's gone.

620
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,813
Gabriel: The guards say
the keys are missing.

621
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:16,859
Whoever stole them
must've let him out.

622
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,908
Who was on watch
last night?

623
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:23,388
Laura was,

624
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,999
but she said she didn't do it,
and I believe her.

625
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,959
Man:
I'd be worried.

626
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:33,093
I did it.

627
00:38:33,136 --> 00:38:35,835
I let Negan out.

628
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:55,637
Come on.
You didn't do this.

629
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,204
Yeah, I did.

630
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:58,510
I kept watch
last night.

631
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,426
You never
left the house.

632
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:06,822
Does it matter?

633
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,304
This is
where they want me.

634
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,611
Doesn't matter
what they want.

635
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:15,527
You know,
for a long time,

636
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,399
I blamed myself
for what happened last year.

637
00:39:19,792 --> 00:39:21,663
Kept thinking,

638
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:25,406
what if I just stayed
in that cell at Hilltop?

639
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,148
If I never
let myself be taken alive

640
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,237
by you people
in the first place?

641
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,675
Never went off
with Henry?

642
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:37,200
Never said
what I said to my mother?

643
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:39,377
You're not to blame
for her.

644
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,030
My mother was right.

645
00:39:41,074 --> 00:39:46,166
She said you people
put on these polite faces,

646
00:39:46,209 --> 00:39:47,602
