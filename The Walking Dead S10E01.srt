1
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:59,494
Man: Watch your ranks.
Watch your files.

2
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:19,775
Man: To the right.

3
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:11,174
And halt.

4
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,263
Drop.

5
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:14,830
Archers.

6
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:20,183
Retreat!

7
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,407
Right. And march.

8
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,417
Man: Archers, regroup.

9
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:45,077
-Formation.
-And halt.

10
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:49,995
Man: Spears.

11
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,179
Man: Thrust!

12
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,289
-And halt.

13
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:24,552
Woman: Open ranks.

14
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,316
Hold on, Jerry.

15
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,969
Jerry:
I'm tryin', boss.

16
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:54,495
Back up. Back up.

17
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:55,583
Michonne: It's about
to get real, y'all.

18
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,019
Everyone, steady.

19
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:12,948
Fan out!

20
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,258
Michonne: Hey,
stay in your formations!

21
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:19,998
Remember your trainin'!

22
00:04:49,898 --> 00:04:51,726
On me.

23
00:05:10,397 --> 00:05:11,963
Luke: Weirdest thing
you ever pulled outta

24
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,356
one of these ghost ships --
go.

25
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,575
Oh, that would
definitely be

26
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:16,359
the crate full
of hot-dog trophies.

27
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,360
Is that a euphemism?

28
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,883
What are you
talkin' 'bout?

29
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,668
No.

30
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:24,541
Literally trophies
shaped like dancing hot dogs.

31
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,500
-Okay.
-I mean, I guess they --

32
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,676
they sorta
looked euphemistic.

33
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,242
Okay.

34
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,376
Do you need help
with that?

35
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,465
Um, no --Look like you need
a strong woman

36
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,163
to help you with that --
among other things.

37
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:41,384
I mean, y-yes, please.

38
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:42,907
Thank you.

39
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,387
Hey, Jules, um...

40
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,258
a-are you --

41
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:49,392
Yes, I am flirting with you
a little bit, Luke.

42
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,262
Yes.

43
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,439
Good. That's cool.

44
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:53,788
As am I with you.

45
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,877
Oh. Well, thanks.

46
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,966
Training
was worth the trip.

47
00:05:58,009 --> 00:05:59,837
Yeah, they did good.
Mm.

48
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,578
Tara would've been proud.

49
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:04,538
Hm. Hope so.

50
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,453
It's good
to bring the kids also,

51
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,369
let 'em see the ocean
for the first time.

52
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,372
Yeah, I know one idiot
that would've loved this.

53
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:17,942
Judith: ♪ 15 miles
on the Erie Canal ♪

54
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:23,339
♪ She's a good ol' worker
and a good ol' pal ♪

55
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,429
♪ 15 miles
on the Erie Canal ♪

56
00:06:33,871 --> 00:06:36,178
It was a fun day at the river
today, huh, R.J.?

57
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,484
Yeah.

58
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:39,703
Let's see
what you found.

59
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:45,116
Kids found it
by the estuary.

60
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,683
River must've
carried it down.

61
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:48,250
Gabriel:
What does it mean?

62
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,512
Are they back?

63
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,905
We don't know.

64
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,255
But Alexandria should go
on lockdown just in case.

65
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,258
Hold on.

66
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,478
We don't have evidence
to justify that.

67
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,696
My official recommendation

68
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,611
is that everyone
should stay on alert

69
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:02,656
until further notice.

70
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:03,787
Eyes and ears open.

71
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:05,049
That's it.

72
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:09,227
Copy that.
Over and out.

73
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,794
Sounds good.

74
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,274
Over and out.

75
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,799
I appreciate your caution,
and I get it,

76
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,888
but we do not need
to start a panic.

77
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,630
A lot of stuff washed up ashore
from the recent storm.

78
00:08:20,674 --> 00:08:22,197
Th-This might not
mean anything.

79
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,677
Or it might
mean something.

80
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,679
Look, no one saw
Alpha's herd move out,

81
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,898
so maybe no one saw them
move back in.

82
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,465
But if there's a mask,

83
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,250
maybe there are other signs
of them out there.

84
00:08:32,294 --> 00:08:33,687
We owe it to our people
to be sure.

85
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,519
I'll gather a group.
We'll leave in five.

86
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,564
I'm-a hang back
for a bit.

87
00:08:41,608 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll catch up.

88
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:46,003
Tell her not to leave again
without saying goodbye.

89
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:47,701
Alright.

90
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,749
Michonne:
Okay, let's split up.

91
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:55,665
You see any sign of them,
call it in.

92
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,433
Aaron: Michonne...
Yeah.

93
00:09:24,476 --> 00:09:27,610
...are we
the good guys?

94
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,177
Why would you ask that?

95
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,832
I think about it a lot.

96
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,052
We're the villains
of someone else's story,

97
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,880
a threat
to their survival,

98
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:40,144
so dangerous they threaten
to wipe us out.

99
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:44,932
Makes you wonder
sometimes.

100
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:46,977
I don't give a shit
about the Whisperers

101
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,370
or where they stand.

102
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:50,764
I'm not just talkin'
'bout the Whisperers.

103
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,579
Anything?

104
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,450
Yumiko:
Nothing so far.

105
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:29,498
Luke: Nada over here.

106
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,935
You know, we may never
find an answer to this.

107
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:33,371
They cover their tracks.

108
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,417
If there's a mask,
there's a reason.

109
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,551
Come on.

110
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,770
Hey! Shit.

111
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:42,032
Come on.

112
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,298
Whoa.

113
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,831
Watch their hands!

114
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,577
Damn it.

115
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,844
Duck!

116
00:11:21,593 --> 00:11:23,770
Well, that was stupid.

117
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:25,772
We agreed not
to cross their borders

118
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:28,122
or to start anything
without a reason.

119
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,950
I lost Rick on a --

120
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,829
If it was them,
you could've died.

121
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,832
And it wasn't them,
and you could've died.

122
00:11:42,876 --> 00:11:45,530
For what?

123
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:49,839
We've all been acting
like this is normal,

124
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:53,060
holding our breaths
for months.

125
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,975
This isn't normal.

126
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:57,847
We have to keep our cool,
or they win.

127
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,371
I've been keeping my cool
my whole life.

128
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:05,550
I've always been the nice guy,
the Good Samaritan.

129
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:10,904
But the thing is,
Eric is dead.

130
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:14,908
Jesus is dead.

131
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,127
And I'm Goddamn sick
of bein' nice.

132
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,042
Well, good,

133
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:21,653
'cause nice
never got me anywhere.

134
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:23,917
But smart did.

135
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,876
They have a nuclear weapon,
and we don't.

136
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,575
It's not about being nice
or good

137
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:32,664
or anything
but keeping our people alive

138
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,884
and not having them die
over nothing.

139
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:42,109
Believe me.

140
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,981
I hate this, too.

141
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:51,553
We should get back
before dark.

142
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,168
We didn't find anything.

143
00:12:58,212 --> 00:13:00,431
We're circling back.

144
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,955
Yumiko: Hold on.

145
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,957
There's something
you all should see.

146
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,382
It's a campsite.

147
00:13:38,426 --> 00:13:39,340
Couple people.

148
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,081
What am I missin'?

149
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:44,040
This is not what
we wanted to show you.

150
00:14:00,056 --> 00:14:02,493
Luke: Campers must've
got into a fight

151
00:14:02,537 --> 00:14:04,365
with these walkers,
right?

152
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:06,758
Or maybe the two things
aren't connected.

153
00:14:27,257 --> 00:14:31,000
Looks like he's been here
for a while.

154
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,632
Aaron: A skin.

155
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:03,815
So at least one of 'em
has been

156
00:15:03,859 --> 00:15:05,295
on our side of the border
at some point.

157
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:07,776
Yeah, but when?

158
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,170
And what the hell
happened here?

159
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:20,006
Michonne:
I can see what's coming
unless we stop it.

160
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,095
Fear is dangerous.

161
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:25,228
It can drive us apart
again.

162
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:29,102
And we're gonna
need to squash it
before it starts.

163
00:15:29,145 --> 00:15:31,756
But fear
can also keep us safe.

164
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,933
I forgot that
on the bridge.

165
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,413
I was telling you
to be smart,

166
00:15:36,457 --> 00:15:39,155
not afraid.

167
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,942
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier,

168
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:45,945
'bout who we've become,
who we are.

169
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,863
And the truth is,

170
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:56,042
we are the good guys.

171
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,958
And I know
who Rick and Carl were --

172
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:02,178
and Eric and Jesus, too.

173
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:05,051
We have to choose
to be the good guys

174
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:09,272
even when it's hard.

175
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:12,667
And...the minute

176
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:16,149
that we start
to question that

177
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:19,891
and we lose sight of it,

178
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,806
that's when the answer
to that question

179
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,199
starts to change,

180
00:16:23,243 --> 00:16:28,813
and that's scarier
than any skin mask.

181
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:41,261
Judith: And the Brave Man
rode the horse very, very far,

182
00:16:41,304 --> 00:16:45,178
trying to lead
the gigantic herd away.

183
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,049
But after a while,

184
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,095
the horse got scared
and ran away,

185
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:51,445
leaving the Brave Man
all alone.

186
00:16:51,488 --> 00:16:55,057
So the Brave Man walked
all by himself to the bridge.

187
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,712
Remember how he built the bridge
for all his friends?
Yeah.

188
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,106
Well,
the millions of walkers

189
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,586
followed the Brave Man
onto the bridge,

190
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,935
and on the other side,

191
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,241
all his friends
were waiting.

192
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:07,069
The Brave Man
couldn't let the walkers

193
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,940
reach his friends
and hurt them,

194
00:17:08,984 --> 00:17:10,159
so he blew up the bridge,

195
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:11,682
and all the walkers
fell into the water

196
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:13,249
and he saved
all his friends.

197
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,772
The end.

198
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,774
Did the Brave Man go to his
friend's house after that?

199
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,080
No.

200
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,126
He died
and went to heaven.

201
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,651
Will he come back someday,
like the walkers?

202
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,262
No, not like that.

203
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:28,699
But people,
like the Brave Man,

204
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:30,484
are never really gone
anyway.

205
00:17:30,527 --> 00:17:33,965
He lives inside our hearts
and makes us brave, too.

206
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,883
Hey.

207
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,711
Is anybody gonna
say hi?

208
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:41,973
-Hi.
-Hi.

209
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:44,106
-Hi.
-Hi, Mom.

210
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,586
Michonne: Come on.

211
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:50,025
Hi. Ooh.

212
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,636
You, too, baby girl.
Come here.

213
00:17:54,769 --> 00:17:55,813
I know, I know.

214
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:57,467
Mm.

215
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,729
Hi.

216
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,082
Mama, I didn't like it
when the Brave Man died.

217
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,170
Why did he do that?

218
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:07,173
Well...

219
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:10,045
there are some people
that you love so much

220
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,787
that you would do
anything for them,

221
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,355
just like I would do
anything for you

222
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:16,965
and for Judith.

223
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,794
And my dad?

224
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:22,449
Yes. And your dad.

225
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:28,194
Alright, bring it back in.
Come on.

226
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,678
-What is that?
-What is it?

227
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,946
Is that
a meteor shower?Michonne: Get back.

228
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,035
-I see it.
-Oh, I see it now.

229
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,691
Woman: What is that?

230
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:51,956
Michonne,
Eugene's on the radio.

231
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,654
He needs
to talk to you now.

232
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,314
Kids found it
by the estuary.

233
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,620
River must've
carried it down.

234
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,622
What does it mean?

235
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,233
Are they back?

236
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,930
Aaron: We don't know.

237
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:12,020
But Alexandria should go
on lockdown just in case.

238
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:13,413
Michonne: Hold on.

239
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,632
We don't have evidence
to justify that.

240
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,286
My official recommendation

241
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,419
is that everyone
should stay on alert

242
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:20,333
until further notice.

243
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,204

Not more, not less.

265
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,453
So if I were
to heat the milk up

266
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:39,455
for, like, 5 minutes
and 18 seconds --

267
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,501
I have rigged
the kitchen timer to go off

268
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,676
at precisely 5 and 16

269
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,721
so such a scenario
will not come to pass.

270
00:20:44,765 --> 00:20:46,462
Furthermore,
I've taken the liberty

271
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,899
of chartin' her feedin's
and diaper changes.

272
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:51,337
She is very regular.
Congratulations.

273
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,296
Eugene, she's a baby,
not a science experiment.

274
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,168
You can't boil people down
to charts and graphs.

275
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,214
No, you know what?
I'll take it.

276
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:03,827
Might not use it all
or, like, any of it,

277
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,307
but thanks.

278
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,439
You know,
ever since everyone

279
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,484
got those damn
radio setups, Eugene,

280
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:11,139
this one's been doing
nothing but talking.

281
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,272
You gotta move that thing
outta the house.

282
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:18,364
Hey, man,
is everything okay?

283
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,672
Lydia:
"Yes, the girl said.

284
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:26,154
I have rec..."

285
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:29,288
"Received."

286
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,553
I've gone my whole life
without reading.

287
00:21:33,596 --> 00:21:35,685
I don't see the point
in learning how to do it now.

288
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,818
It'll open
a whole new world for you.

289
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,254
And you're picking it up
so quick.

290
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,473
You're a natural.

291
00:21:40,516 --> 00:21:42,779
There's nothin' natural
about this.

292
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,310
Gabriel:
We need the room.

293
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,444
Should she be here
for this?

294
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,590
Negan: Hey, kid.

295
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,509
Everything okay?

296
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,816
Fine.

297
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,863
Exactly the same as it was
20 minutes ago.

298
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,517
What was
the big meeting for?

299
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,736
And why are folks
givin' you the side eye?

300
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,610
Same folks eyein' you.

301
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:32,481
What have you done in the past
however many years

302
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,614
you've been here, huh?Brandon: Negan.

303
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:39,706
Get back to work, sir.

304
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:43,710
Hey, you're supposed
to keep your distance.

305
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:49,498
They're on alert.

306
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,500
Why?

307
00:22:51,544 --> 00:22:54,416
Someone found a skin.

308
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,550
What does "alert" mean?

309
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,508
You've been here longer.

310
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:00,988
You tell me.

311
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,904
It means watch your back,
kid.

312
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,226
Hey, boss.

313
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,456
There you go.

314
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:43,422
Oh, hm?
Trippy, right?

315
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,816
Okay, you chill.

316
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,732
I'll be right back.

317
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,849
Dante: Jefe?

318
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,895
Earth to El Jefe.

319
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:25,638
There you are, Jef.

320
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,555
Dante.

321
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:31,600
What are you doing here?

322
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:33,384
Dude, your spawn was
screamin' bloody murder.

323
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,647
I could hear it
down in the infirmary.

324
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,083
I just --

325
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,432
Oh, shit.

326
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,607
I wanted to make sure
you were cool.

327
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:39,869
Hey.

328
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,176
So...

329
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,612
you cool?

330
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:48,748
Just, you know,
dealing with...

331
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:51,533
household pests
and shit.

332
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:52,621
Good thing I got to town

333
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,275
in time for you
to play house.

334
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,844
I reorganized the meds.

335
00:24:57,887 --> 00:24:59,715
Infirmary's hummin'.

336
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:01,848
Might've earned my keep
for the day.

337
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,415
Though, who are we kiddin'?

338
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,766
We're like Gods
in the apocalypse.

339
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:12,728
By the way, this
yellow-alert bidness,

340
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,730
damn.

341
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:19,039
So what's with
this Whisperers thing?

342
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,130
You wanna get a room?

343
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:25,741
E-Excuse me?

344
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,482
The way
you're starin' at my mouth

345
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,050
is makin' me
warm and tingly inside.

346
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,314
Kiss me already.
Shit.

347
00:25:35,316 --> 00:25:36,622
So tempting.

348
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:39,276
Yeah.

349
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,714
But, uh, I need
to get this kid to sleep.

350
00:25:41,757 --> 00:25:44,804
So thank you
for checkin' on me.
Yeah.

351
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,370
Anytime, man.

352
00:25:48,677 --> 00:25:50,505
Or should I say "God"?

353
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,795
I'm surprised you knocked off
work early.

354
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,362
I thought
you couldn't get enough

355
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:22,581
of the great outdoors.

356
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,714
It's starting.

357
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,716
Listen, if you've got
something to say,

358
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,849
can you just please
get to the point?

359
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:31,590
Because I don't
have time today.

360
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,287
Seriously.Aw, Gabey boy,

361
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,637
why don't you just
nestle in below me

362
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:38,422
and let me baby bird
a little bit of my wisdom

363
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,816
into that pretty little mouth
of yours?

364
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,167
You see, people tend
to get mixed up on

365
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,822
about who they hate.

366
00:26:46,866 --> 00:26:52,306
Yesterday,
I was public enemy number one.

367
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,524
Now?

368
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,874
Well, now I'm the guy

369
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:58,442
that picks the vegetables
and takes out the trash.

370
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,662
I'm okay with that.

371
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:02,795
For now, at least.

372
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,972
But until
this whole thing passes,

373
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:09,497
I'm gonna keep my head down
so people don't move me

374
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,542
from the proverbial
semi-"us" category

375
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,762
to the category
of "them."

376
00:27:13,806 --> 00:27:16,504
That's not
what's happening here.

377
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:19,376
I didn't say it is.

378
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,161
I said that it will.

379
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:22,466
You see, the boogeyman

380
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,817
just stuck his
gnarly skin-covered mask

381
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,471
out from behind
that closet door,

382
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,561
and people are puttin'
their shittin' pants back on

383
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:34,696
because pants-shittin'
is definitely happenin'.

384
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,613
Now, with this, uh,
alert shit,

385
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,746
all I'm seein'
is indecision.

386
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:45,315
Now, you ask me,
you gotta make 'em feel secure,

387
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,709
even if it's just
for show.

388
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,058
Sorta like
how you have a guy

389
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:51,408
followin' me around
with a spear all day

390
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:52,714
in case I suddenly decide

391
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:54,716
I'm gonna brain somebody
with a tomato.

392
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,937
So you're telling me
to lie?

393
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,895
That's your advice?

394
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:02,550
That's your regurgitated
bird wisdom?

395
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:03,986
No, not lie.

396
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:07,511
At most, I'm talkin' about
a little strategic omission,

397
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:10,863
maybe minor misleading.

398
00:28:10,906 --> 00:28:14,301
Think of it as
using the truth to manipulate.

399
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:16,782
But, hell,
at the end of the day,

400
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:20,829
if that's what
keeps people alive,

401
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,918
what's the harm?

402
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:43,852
Lock the gates
for the night,

403
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,115
and let's double up security
at the walls.

404
00:29:00,913 --> 00:29:03,524
Alexandria to Oceanside.
Come in, Oceanside.

405
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:04,786
Please, pick up.

406
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:05,961
Rachel:
Oceanside copies.

407
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,876
This is Rachel.This is Eugene.

408
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,312
I need
to speak with Michonne

409
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,837
and any of the community
leadership at O.S. right away.

410
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,274
Somethin' of grave importance
is about to happen.

411
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,803
Kids found it
by the estuary.

412
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:23,370
River must've
carried it down.

413
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:25,285
Gabriel:
What does it mean?

414
00:29:25,328 --> 00:29:27,200
Are they back?

415
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:28,375
Woman: Pull!

416
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,559
Crap.
Heads up, Kel.

417
00:29:38,602 --> 00:29:39,995
Woman: Go further!

418
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,388
That's further!

419
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,737
Heads up behind you,
Kel.

420
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,870
Watch your step.

421
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:46,610
Woman:
Alright, let it drop.

422
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,221
Sorry.

423
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:35,502
You ever wonder
why they call bird shit "guano"?

424
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,025
Nah.

425
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:39,114
I just call it
bird shit.

426
00:31:39,158 --> 00:31:42,117
Yeah.

427
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:43,989
Me, too.

428
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:49,081
You know somethin',
when I worked in a zoo,

429
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:51,866
birds used to scare
the hell out of me.

430
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,259
Lions, tigers, no problem.

431
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:55,783
There's a kind of sense
to the way big cats operate.

432
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:58,960
But ostriches?

433
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:01,006
Those things'll disembowel you
for lookin' at 'em sideways.

434
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:06,446
You gotta eat more birds,
show 'em who's boss.

435
00:32:06,489 --> 00:32:09,449
Wonder what seagull
tastes like.

436
00:32:09,492 --> 00:32:10,580
Not chicken.

437
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:18,197
Hi. Hi, buddy. Hi.

438
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:23,115
Uh.

439
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:28,076
No, he just likes you
better.

440
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,208
Right?

441
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:32,994
Hi. Hi.

442
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,128
Good Dog.

443
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,922
Really?

444
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:54,929
Hey.

445
00:33:09,117 --> 00:33:10,771
Carol.

446
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,519
Hey.

447
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:21,434
Hey.

448
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:22,478
It's good to see you.

449
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:24,698
You, too.

450
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,091
You look good.

451
00:33:26,134 --> 00:33:28,006
Thanks.

452
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,138
Sorry. Um, excuse me.

453
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:31,792
Yeah.

454
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:42,281
Did ya miss me?

455
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:43,630
Not really.

456
00:33:43,673 --> 00:33:45,284
I'll take that.

457
00:33:49,853 --> 00:33:54,075
So, how was it
out there?

458
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,296
Work till you feel like
your back's gonna break,

459
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:58,775
then you work some more,

460
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:00,125
and at the end of the night,

461
00:34:00,168 --> 00:34:02,692
you fall down and
sleep like the dead

462
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:05,173
on a deck
under the stars.

463
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,740
It's the best.

464
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,176
You find
what you were lookin' for?

465
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,787
Oh, then we sailed down south
to this dock

466
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:14,313
where Oceanside's been
pickin' up letters from Maggie.

467
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:16,967
Wasn't anything there.
Hasn't been for a while.

468
00:34:17,011 --> 00:34:19,100
It's been a while
since I heard from ya.

469
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:21,537
I told you,
fishing's hard.

470
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:23,974
That's not what I mean.

471
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:26,281
You were lookin' for her,
weren't ya?

472
00:34:26,325 --> 00:34:28,501
No.
Mm-hmm.

473
00:34:28,544 --> 00:34:30,416
Honestly, no.

474
00:34:30,459 --> 00:34:32,983
Tried to forget
everything that happened.

475
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:34,463
It was good.

476
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:36,248
And if we're lucky,
we'll never have to think about

477
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,077
those skin freaks
ever again.

478
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:44,082
What?

479
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,954
We found
one of their masks today.

480
00:34:49,391 --> 00:34:51,611
Okay.

481
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:53,830
Michonne just took a group out
looking for signs of 'em.

482
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,876
You wanna go?

483
00:34:57,486 --> 00:34:59,836
No.

484
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,099
I'm only -- I'm only here

485
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,362
till the next boat
heads out.

486
00:35:03,405 --> 00:35:05,755
Alright.

487
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,236
So, what you wanna do?

488
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,327
Carol: Never been
through here before.

489
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,155
Daryl: Yeah,
we just cleared it out

490
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:16,244
to get around
the river border.

491
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:19,334
Faster.

492
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:20,814
Hang on.

493
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:43,053
I had that one.

494
00:35:43,097 --> 00:35:45,969
Well, you're supposed
to call it.

495
00:35:46,013 --> 00:35:47,928
You didn't call it.

496
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,190
Don't wanna play
with you anymore

497
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,539
if you cheat every time.

498
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:52,019
I'm not cheating.

499
00:35:54,456 --> 00:35:56,589
Watch their hands.

500
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,466
Stop.

501
00:36:47,509 --> 00:36:48,641
Why?

502
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:51,209
It's one of her borders.

503
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,297
They're walkers.

504
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,037
We can still get the deer.

505
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:55,604
No, it's too late.

506
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:59,086
Why are we still
respecting borders
we never agreed to

507
00:36:59,129 --> 00:37:00,522
when Alpha
isn't even here?

508
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:03,264
Can we just forget
bout them already?It's too late.

509
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:13,361
That deer could've fed
200 people.

510
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:27,767
I'm sorry
I pissed you off.

511
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,813
I'm sorry you pissed me off,
too.

512
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:34,164
Well, there's no reason
to start shit if we don't gotta.

513
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:36,471
After the storm,
we all agreed to that.

514
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:41,476
That's why it's just as well
that I left.

515
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:46,829
Yeah, I've been
thinkin' about that.

516
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:49,876
Why don't
you come on home now?

517
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:52,313
I'm a sea dog, man.

518
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:56,317
Would you get off my ass
before I put you on yours?

519
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,451
Sorry if I didn't want
my best friend

520
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,497
to spend her whole life
on a boat.

521
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:04,760
Best friend?

522
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:06,327
What are you, 10?

523
00:38:06,371 --> 00:38:08,068
Whatever.

524
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:10,679
Should we have
matching bracelets now?

525
00:38:10,723 --> 00:38:12,420
Oh, God, forget it.

526
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:14,640
No, I could make some
with fisherman's twine.

527
00:38:14,683 --> 00:38:16,555
Decorate 'em.

528
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:18,252
It'll be really cute
with tiny, little seashells.

529
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,471
Oh, my God.
I take it back.

530
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,386
No,
what's your favorite color?

531
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,996
Green? Blue?

532
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:25,781
Black.
Definitely black.

533
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,043
I got an idea.

534
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,307
Why don't we eat
and not talk?

535
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,964
Should we make
a matching collar for Dog?

536
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:51,416
Daryl?

537
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:54,549
Yeah?

538
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:58,118
You ever wonder
if this is all there is?

539
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:01,469
Just run into people,

540
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:03,123
kill each other

541
00:39:03,166 --> 00:39:05,343
until whoever's left
says enough?

542
00:39:05,386 --> 00:39:07,432
Sometimes
I think we're just survivin'

543
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:08,911
one fight to the next.

544
00:39:08,955 --> 00:39:12,393
It was like that for you and me
before all this.

545
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:13,612
Yep.

546
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:16,658
There's got to be people
out there like us.

547
00:39:16,702 --> 00:39:18,878
Right?

548
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,799
I get what Maggie's doin'
with Georgie.

549
00:39:26,842 --> 00:39:29,236
I do.

550
00:39:32,152 --> 00:39:34,415
Go out on the boat with me
this time.

551
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:37,592
Just run away together?

552
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:41,509
Be pirates. Heck yeah.

553
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:42,684
Nah.

554
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:45,383
Cooped up in those little cabins
all day?

555
00:39:45,426 --> 00:39:48,298
That's not me.

556
00:39:48,342 --> 00:39:49,561
Screw the boat.

557
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:52,694
We'll take your bike
and go out on the road.

558
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:54,479
Better.

559
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:56,002
Head out West.

560
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,265
New Mexico.

561
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:00,789
What the hell's
in New Mexico?

562
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,791
People
who weave bracelets.

563
00:40:06,012 --> 00:40:09,450
No more fightin'.

564
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:12,235
Just get on the bike
and go,

565
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,237
see who's left.

566
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,292
Sounds good to me.

567
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:57,498
Magna: This is crazy.
We can't do this.We don't have a choice.

568
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,152
If we get caught on
their side of the border,

569
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:01,415
that's it, that's war.It's a fire.
Fires spread.

570
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,462
It could burn through
our hunting grounds.Or take out Oceanside.

571
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:07,682
Michonne,
are we doin' this?

572
00:41:07,726 --> 00:41:10,598
-We gotta go now.
-Let's go. Come on.

573
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:45,285
We start on the outside,
push in.

574
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,921
It's gonna be
a long night, son.

575
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,054
A long, hot night.

576
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,364
Aaron: As soon as you clear
your area, move to the ends.

577
00:42:21,408 --> 00:42:23,062
Keep digging.

578
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:25,717
We've gotta get this done
before the fire jumps spine.

579
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,589
-Come on.
- God damn it.

580
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:30,373
-Magna.

581
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,593
-Magna.

582
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,595
Yumiko: Magna.Magna: What?

583
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,466
You're spinning out.I'm fine.

584
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:38,164
No, you're not.
What's wrong?

585
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,296
Look around.

586
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,226
-Where we going? Where we going?
-To the fire line.

587
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:59,751
Grab your bucket.

588
00:43:01,927 --> 00:43:03,668
Aaron: Alright,
everybody clear back.

589
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:05,408
Clear back.

590
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:06,975
We need to back-burn
the stray fuel

591
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,195
by the control line
so the fire can't spread.

592
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:10,762
Yumiko:
Let's light it up.

593
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:47,537
Yo, boss.

594
00:43:47,581 --> 00:43:49,409
Not your boss, Jerry.

595
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:50,932
Pace yourself maybe.

596
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:53,065
It's gonna take a minute.

597
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,111
Fire was the beginning
of the end for the Kingdom.

598
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,331
We're not letting that happen
to Oceanside.

599
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:00,725
You okay, boss?

600
00:44:00,768 --> 00:44:04,163
Let me take point
in this round, okay?

601
00:44:14,303 --> 00:44:18,612
Cyndie:
I'm outta water.

602
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,918
Daryl: I'm out.

603
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:29,710
Man: Hey!
Walkers coming in!

604
00:44:29,754 --> 00:44:31,712
Man: On your six!Daryl.

605
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,888
Bring the weapons.

606
00:44:37,587 --> 00:44:39,546
Magna: Heads up!

607
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:41,722
Man:
Yeah, yeah, we're good.

608
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:01,046
Man: How many we got?

609
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:27,072
Woman: Come on!

610
00:45:27,115 --> 00:45:29,901
Man: Let's stay on the fire.
Put it out.

611
00:45:29,944 --> 00:45:32,164
Walkers!

612
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:34,122
There's too many!

613
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:47,701
Lead them to the fire!

614
00:46:15,076 --> 00:46:18,558
Come on! Go, go!

615
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:22,649
Hurry!

616
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:29,961
Here!

617
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:36,315
Man: Watch your back!

618
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:06,127
There's too many of 'em!

619
00:47:06,171 --> 00:47:08,869
Everyone, stay clear
of that tree!

620
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,436
It's gonna fall any minuto!

621
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,614
Get back.

622
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:18,748
Get outta here!

623
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:07,058
Michonne: Come on, come on.
Pack up and move.

624
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:09,495
Aaron:
Let's go, let's go!

625
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:11,932
Eugene, let's go.

626
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:14,456
I just need 20 minutes.You get zero.

627
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,415
We gotta go now.Ten. Just 10.

628
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,896
We should excavate and transport
this satellite to our vehicles.

629
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:22,203
I believe there may be
invaluable technological
implications for our communities

630
00:48:22,247 --> 00:48:25,032
if I'm able to retrieve any of
the useful bits from inside.

631
00:48:25,076 --> 00:48:27,165
I'm not askin'.
Oh, my God.

632
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:30,603
Yumiko, Luke, Magna,
everybody, come on.

633
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:34,215
We're helpin'
with the satellite.
Five minutes and out.

634
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:43,616
Hey, uh, Eugenius,
what about radiation, man?

635
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:45,923
Uh, there's radiation
all around us.

636
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,620
Certainly, there's radiation
from space,

637
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:50,579
but every one of us
is already infected
with some kinda nasty

638
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:53,843
that changes us into epidermis
Epicureans at point of R.I.P.

639
00:48:53,887 --> 00:48:56,934
I mean, I don't understand
what you're talkin' about.I got it, man.

640
00:48:56,977 --> 00:48:59,980
No one's gettin' superpowers
today. I'm on it.

641
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:03,027
Cuttin' into my 10 minutes.

642
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,551
Alright.

643
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:09,294
We made
the right choice.

644
00:49:09,337 --> 00:49:11,687
Let's not push our luck.

645
00:49:11,731 --> 00:49:13,907
Well, maybe this
buys us some goodwill.

646
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,996
This helps them, too.

647
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,650
We helped ourpeople.

648
00:49:17,693 --> 00:49:20,044
That's enough good for me
for now.

649
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:25,136
Where are Carol
and Daryl?

650
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:39,672
You still wanna run away
together?

651
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,370
Yeah.

652
00:49:42,414 --> 00:49:45,069
Tomorrow.

653
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:50,030
Look, I need you to stay.

654
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:57,298
Just think about it.

655
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:04,914
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to
punch holes in all them boats.
