1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:02,480
Previously onSupergirl...

2
00:00:02,524 --> 00:00:03,699
I can't help
thinking that...

3
00:00:03,742 --> 00:00:05,135
if I had done
things differently

4
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:06,528
with my friendship
with Lena,

5
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:08,138
maybe things would have
turned out differently.

6
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,661
There's no way of knowing.

7
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,323
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm confused.

8
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,848
This is your all-powerful
Fifth Dimensional stalker?

9
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:24,328
No. I don't know who this is.

10
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:27,027
I am Mr. Mxyzptlk,

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,159
just as I'm sure
that you, Kara Danvers,

12
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:31,161
are Su--

13
00:00:31,205 --> 00:00:32,858
Get in here.

14
00:00:32,902 --> 00:00:35,731
Thank you so much.

15
00:00:35,774 --> 00:00:37,211
I can't just come in anymore.
I have to be invited.

16
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:39,126
Tell me who you are
and what you want, now.

17
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,171
I'm your one true love,
your soulmate,

18
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:42,868
your one true ''pairing''
as the kids say.

19
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:45,697
My name is Mxyzptlk,
and I love you, Kara Zor-El.

20
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:48,048
Okay. If you...

21
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,527
-Aw, come on.

22
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:51,877
If you are Mxy,
then why do you look like this?

23
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,923
Okay, I only took on
that other form

24
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:56,360
and sophisticated accent
to impress you.

25
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,709
But it worked.

26
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:58,884
You caught me.

27
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,451
Tricked me.

28
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:01,583
No,
I followed the rules.

29
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,585
You say your name backwards,

30
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:05,935
you go back
to the Fifth Dimension,
no questions asked.

31
00:01:05,978 --> 00:01:07,719
Ah,
I miss that hair.

32
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:08,851
I really, really do.

33
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,115
But now, I can't use
any of my powers,

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,901
except to help those
whom I have wronged.

35
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:17,381
Oh, how sad for you.

36
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,817
Yes.

37
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,733
A tragedy
of Shakespearean proportions,
I agree.

38
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,431
But great news.

39
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:24,910
You're the last one.

40
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,739
What could I
possibly need your help for?

41
00:01:27,783 --> 00:01:29,741
I killed
my brother for you,

42
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:32,440
for our friends!
Don't you understand
what you've done?

43
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:40,100
Your best friend thinks
that she is your enemy.

44
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,579
And the worst part...

45
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:43,407
It's your fault.

46
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,669
You hid the truth from her.

47
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,237
You let her find out
from that sadist, Lex,

48
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,586
and now, you think

49
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,935
she could be capable
of anything.

50
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:53,635
-What's your point?
-My point, toots, is this.

51
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,028
Careful.

52
00:01:56,986 --> 00:02:00,642
I am offering you a do-over.

53
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:01,991
Hmm?

54
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,775
I could send you back in time.

55
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:06,169
Wouldn't you like
to be able to tell Lena
that you're Supergirl

56
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,997
on your own terms?

57
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,131
Wouldn't you like to see...

58
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,785
what the world
would look like...

59
00:02:13,829 --> 00:02:15,352
if you controlled
the narrative?

60
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:19,139
-Haven't you hurt enough?

61
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,314
-Hmm?

62
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:22,968
I get it.

63
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:24,274
You don't trust me.

64
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:26,972
Okay, but how's this?

65
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:29,279
Ready? Now,
by Fifth Dimensional law,

66
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:32,152
I am required
to give you this recording

67
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:33,805
of me saying
my name backwards,

68
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,504
in case you ever need
to banish me
to my Fifth Dimension,

69
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,679
-which I know that you--
- Kltpzyxm.

70
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:42,727
I'm not a villain.

71
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,861
You shouldn't have
treated me like one.

72
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,171
Hey, girls.

73
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:54,739
What's going on?

74
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,840
You're not seriously thinking
of doing this, are you?

75
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:11,234
What if I could change things?

76
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:14,063
If I told Lena
that I was Supergirl
before Lex,

77
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:15,673
maybe she would have
reacted differently.

78
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:17,675
I mean,
isn't that worth a try?

79
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:20,200
Changing history
to save a friendship?

80
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,549
-Kara, I don't...
I don't know.
-No.

81
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,204
This is changing history
to save history,

82
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,684
'cause Lex and Lena
are planning
something horrible,

83
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,556
and we are no closer
to finding out what that is.

84
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:30,732
And when the fight comes...

85
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:33,256
I don't know if I have
what it takes to stop her.

86
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,562
Kara...

87
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,738
are you sure
you can trust Mxy?

88
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,609
No.

89
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,569
But the tape recorder worked.

90
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,354
I... I could always just use it
to get him to go away.

91
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,790
All right,
listen to me.

92
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,053
If you really think
that this is your best chance

93
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:50,621
to set things right with Lena
before she hurts somebody...

94
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:53,581
then do it.

95
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:54,930
Okay.

96
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:58,238
Uh... How do I do this?

97
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,282
Um...

98
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:03,286
- Oh!
- Oh, God.

99
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,723
Thank Zook
you changed your mind.

100
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,073
Yes, I'm still working
on eavesdropping.
That's a problem.

101
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:11,294
Okay, uh,
before we do this, Mxy,
I need your word

102
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,600
that if things go sideways,

103
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:13,731
you'll put it all
back to normal.

104
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,951
I am court-ordered to do so.

105
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:17,735
Boop.

106
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,911
Now, no shade
to the Super Friends,

107
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:22,610
but it tends to work better
when it's just me
and the subject.

108
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:24,786
So, do you two
have any plans?

109
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:26,788
-No. I don't think so.
-No. No, we were just gonna--

110
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:28,398
What...

111
00:04:28,442 --> 00:04:29,747
Where did they go?

112
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,140
Oh...
They're in their happy place.

113
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,451
Magic rules!

114
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,322
Game on, Danvers!

115
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:40,584
All right, so,

116
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:41,933
how does this work?

117
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:43,979
I will show you
relevant parts of your life.

118
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,459
You'll tell me when to pause,

119
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:46,329
I will snap,

120
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:47,809
like thus,

121
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,985
sending you back.

122
00:04:50,028 --> 00:04:51,421
You will change history.

123
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,336
Once you have
confronted Lena,
you will come back,

124
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,425
we will watch from your loft
and the safety of your couch.

125
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,427
If you are comfortable
with the domino effect...

126
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,778
I will then snap again,

127
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,171
at which point,

128
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:04,347
-it will become reality.

129
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:05,827
-Okay?
-Okay.

130
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,656
So, three years of friendship.
Where did it go wrong?

131
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:13,835
Well...

132
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,619
Uh-huh.

133
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:19,014
When Lena told me
that she knew I was Supergirl,

134
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,450
-she was furious.
-Yeah.

135
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,626
-She said I made
a fool out of her.
-Uh-huh.

136
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:24,454
She was humiliated.

137
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,849
Okay, so, we're looking for
a moment where you made
your best friend

138
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,807
feel like a big,
dumb idiot. Yeah?

139
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:31,461
-In so many words.
-Okay.

140
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:34,682
Well, we have
an embarrassment of riches.

141
00:05:36,727 --> 00:05:39,339
-Get your seatbelt back on.
I'm gonna land this plane.

142
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,515
- Oh, yeah,
this is a good one.
- Oh.

143
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:44,039
Mmm.

144
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:46,041
Kara? Kara?

145
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,044
God, I hate flying.

146
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,219
- Oh!
-Ugh. This is awful!

147
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:51,742
-I'm awful!
-You're awful.

148
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,485
I was just agreeing with you.
I would never say that.

149
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,747
-Uh-huh.
-Okay.

150
00:05:58,575 --> 00:05:59,881
- Oh, okay.
- Ah.

151
00:05:59,924 --> 00:06:02,057
Let's go to
before Mercy attacks.

152
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,188
- Right there?
- Mmm-hmm.

153
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,189
- You sure?
- Yes.

154
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,103
Don't mess it up.

155
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,023
To be honest,
I didn't have much faith
in politicians to begin with.

156
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,938
I just don't think
any of them can be trusted.

157
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,202
Don't look
so scandalized, Kara.

158
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,595
You know how cynical I can be.

159
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,730
Is everything okay?

160
00:06:26,124 --> 00:06:28,866
You shouldn't have to
be so cynical.

161
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,694
You're good and righteous,

162
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,566
and... and the tragedy is,

163
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,698
the world has made you cynical

164
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:37,701
because you've been betrayed
so many times.

165
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:39,921
By your mother,
by your brother...

166
00:06:41,749 --> 00:06:43,403
and now, by me.

167
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,753
What are you talking about?

168
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,936
I'm not who you think I am.

169
00:06:57,286 --> 00:06:58,418
I'm Supergirl.

170
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:06,426
I never meant to deceive you.

171
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,646
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

172
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,434
You stay here.
I'll deal with this.

173
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:22,790
Lena?

174
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,446
What happened?
Where'd she go?

175
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,449
Ah. Events are unfolding
differently now.

176
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,799
Oh, boy. Um,
I need to catch up.

177
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,757
- Ah,
there she is.

178
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,019
She went to Metropolis.

179
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:36,630
Oh, my God.

180
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,283
She went to see Sam.

181
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:41,635
So, Kara is Supergirl?

182
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:44,289
Yeah, I know.
My head's kind of spinning.

183
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,990
When you were Reign,
and I made Kryptonite
to stop you...

184
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:53,473
You know, in response,
Supergirl was so horrible.

185
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,605
And then, Kara was the same.

186
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:57,651
She was so kind and supportive.

187
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:01,350
But it made me think,
which was the real Kara?

188
00:08:02,656 --> 00:08:05,049
And if the real Kara thought
I was a villain...

189
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,968
then maybe
that's all I really am.

190
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:13,971
No, Lena, no.
How could you ever think that?

191
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:17,322
Lena, you made Kryptonite
to split me from Reign

192
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,803
and to save my life.

193
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,849
You were never the villain.

194
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,504
You were always the hero.

195
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,029
Thank you.

196
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,642
I really needed to hear that.

197
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,645
The Lena
in this timeline
might never forgive me.

198
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:36,690
She might even hate me.

199
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:40,215
You know what?
You know what?

200
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:43,000
If Sam stops her
from going down a dark path,

201
00:08:43,044 --> 00:08:44,175
I can live with that.

202
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,829
Except you literally can't.

203
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:46,700
What do you mean?

204
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,399
Oh, my God.

205
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:53,054
This is the night
Agent Liberty poisoned the air
with Kryptonite.

206
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,713
Uh,
you know what?

207
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,062
Maybe we should shut this off.

208
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:02,063
-Huh?
-No, no, no.

209
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,368
Lena saved me the first time.

210
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,022
She might hate me,
but she'll save me again.

211
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:07,068
She wants to,
but she'll never
make it in time.

212
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,079
Hey, Kara.

213
00:09:18,122 --> 00:09:20,603
I'm sorry
I missed Thanksgiving.

214
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:23,954
We're just...
We're so lost without you.

215
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,262
I...

216
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,135
am so lost without you.

217
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,579
Happy late Thanksgiving.

218
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,279
Oh.
Can you please turn it off?

219
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:46,977
I can't watch any more of this.
Just stop it!

220
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:50,459
That was horrible.

221
00:09:50,502 --> 00:09:51,939
Obviously, you don't want
to stay dead.

222
00:09:51,982 --> 00:09:53,593
-No!
-No!

223
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,641
No, I have to go back further.

224
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:02,776
I get it now.

225
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,604
I get it now.

226
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,780
My dual identities
made Lena think

227
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,608
that she couldn't trust
either side of me.

228
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,522
I was a hypocrite.

229
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:14,265
Okay, so, when exactly
did this Kryptonite-fueled
tete-a-tete happen?

230
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,835
Ah... It was... It was, uh,
just after we found out
Lena was housing Reign.

231
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,100
Lena, the Worldkillers
are coming.

232
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,319
-We have to
get you someplace--
-Mmm...

233
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:25,363
-Skip forward.
-Skip.

234
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,977
You are never going to make
Kryptonite ever again.

235
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:35,460
-You really do
have a God-complex.
- See, there.

236
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:38,289
-This fight is what
I'm trying to avoid.
-Mmm-hmm. Okay.

237
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,551
So, go back.

238
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,687
I need you to find out
if there really isn't
any Kryptonite left.

239
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:48,169
Kara, you're asking me
to betray somebody
that I really care about.

240
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,910
I never should have done that.

241
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,520
-Uh, yeah, it has to
be before this.
-Yeah, hang on, before.

242
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,826
We have to go back further.

243
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:54,697
-Here.
-Yep.

244
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:56,351
My friend came to me.

245
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,658
She was alone and afraid.
I had to do something.

246
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,182
I need you to level with me.

247
00:11:02,531 --> 00:11:04,011
Do you have
any more Kryptonite?

248
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,665
-This is it.
-Mmm-hmm.

249
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,710
This is the moment
that Lena started
to distrust Supergirl.

250
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,712
-This is when
I have to tell her, so...
-Okay.

251
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:11,148
Mmm...

252
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,151
Beam me up, Mxy.

253
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,196
You don't have a catchphrase?

254
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:17,415
We'll work on that.

255
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:21,550
''Girl power!'' No.

256
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,031
My friend came to me.

257
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:25,685
She was alone and afraid.
I had to do something.

258
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,209
That feeling of needing
to protect your friend,

259
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:29,689
no matter
what the world thinks...

260
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:33,214
I understand that
more than you know.

261
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:36,391
You once told me

262
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,523
Kara Danvers was your hero.

263
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,090
I never told you that.
I told...

264
00:11:43,877 --> 00:11:44,878
It's me, Lena.

265
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,055
I've always been Kara.

266
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,536
Kara, how could you?

267
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,321
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you sooner.

268
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,411
Three weeks ago,
I found out that Sam,
one of my closest friends,

269
00:11:56,454 --> 00:11:58,108
was a homicidal Kryptonian.

270
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,546
I went
through that terror alone.

271
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,375
I risked my life
day after day for weeks

272
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,029
because I believed
that I was the only one

273
00:12:06,073 --> 00:12:08,597
who could be trusted
to protect her, to save her.

274
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:10,599
I could have used your help.

275
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,732
I would have used your help

276
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,864
if you'd bothered to tell me
the truth before now.

277
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,344
If you'd trusted me then,

278
00:12:16,387 --> 00:12:17,780
I wouldn't have had to
go through that danger alone!

279
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,042
I'm so sorry,

280
00:12:19,086 --> 00:12:22,393
but I thought
I was protecting you.

281
00:12:22,437 --> 00:12:26,049
But now, we can...
we can move past it
and work as partners.

282
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,617
You expect me
to be your partner after this?

283
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:31,402
When all you've done
is prove to me

284
00:12:31,446 --> 00:12:33,100
that you can't
be trusted at all?

285
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,279
Oh, no.

286
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,243
I...

287
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,767
-I forgot.
-Yeah.

288
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,899
-The Worldkiller started
an eclipse that day.
-Mmm-hmm.

289
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:51,771
-So, you forgot the...
forgot the eclipse...

290
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:53,424
...and then, you also forgot
the Kryptonite bomb.

291
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,686
You know what
we're not gonna do?

292
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,601
We're not gonna rely
on your memory anymore

293
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,299
for maybe, like,
big, important details.

294
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,083
-Just sayin'.

295
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,693
We got to try something else.

296
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,260
-How about here?
-No! No.
Just let this play out a bit,

297
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:05,262
-because in the original
version of events...
-Mmm-hmm.

298
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,787
...Lena helped me and the DEO
to fight the Worldkillers.

299
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,266
-Okay.
-I know she's upset right now,

300
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,267
but she's gonna help us.

301
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,616
Welcome to the bizarro version

302
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,096
where she does not
help the DEO,

303
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,315
-right... right here.
-What?

304
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:16,926
Oh, God! No.

305
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,450
-If Lena doesn't help us
fight the Worldkillers, then--
-Yep.

306
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:20,974
Wait, wait, wait.

307
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,627
Wait. You're skipping a lot!

308
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,151
This is all exposition,
so much exposition.

309
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:25,630
Hold on! Was that Mon-El?

310
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,936
Yes.

311
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,503
-So, he didn't go
back to the future?
-No.

312
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:31,636
Huh. Of course.

313
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,856
If we didn't
defeat Pestilence,

314
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,162
-then he would have
been there with us...
-Uh-huh.

315
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,511
...when we went
to Sam's mom's house.

316
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:38,339
Can you...
Can you snap me in there?

317
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:39,514
I want to get his perspective.

318
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:41,995
I never understood
what you saw in him.

319
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:50,525
You need to leave
for your own safety.

320
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,353
I... I won't leave my daughter.

321
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:54,834
I failed her
when she was a girl.

322
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,400
I refuse to fail her again.

323
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:57,967
Well, is there
at least a safe place
for you to hide?

324
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:59,229
There's a safe room.

325
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:01,536
I'll wait there.

326
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,368
-We should take up
defensive positions.
-No, wait. Um...

327
00:14:08,064 --> 00:14:09,196
I need your advice.

328
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,548
I finally told Lena
I'm Supergirl.

329
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,506
Wow.

330
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,899
How... How did she take it?

331
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,770
Not well.

332
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:21,338
And I don't blame her.
I mean, I'm supposed to
be her best friend,

333
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:22,992
and I... I lied

334
00:14:23,036 --> 00:14:25,690
and betrayed her
just like everyone else
in her life has.

335
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,736
So, what do I do?

336
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,088
You know, Lena and I
have a lot in common.

337
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:37,224
We've both been betrayed
by our own families.

338
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:40,009
And when the people
who are supposed to
love you the most

339
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:42,229
let you down,
it just makes you feel so...

340
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:44,753
so vulnerable, you know?

341
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:47,190
But my mother and the Luthors,

342
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:50,019
they betrayed Lena
for their own selfish reasons.

343
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,194
They...

344
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,066
They wanted to
take advantage of her.

345
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,417
You lied to... to protect her.

346
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,941
Because she's your friend.

347
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:03,380
Now, I know Lena's hurting
right now, but...

348
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:04,904
once she understands that...

349
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,732
she'll forgive you.

350
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,039
I hope you're right.

351
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,433
But I don't think
I'll ever be able
to forgive myself.

352
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,959
You know it's okay
to mess up, right?

353
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:20,093
No matter how many
mistakes I've made,
you've always forgiven me.

354
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:26,099
You should, uh, know that
you deserve
the same compassion

355
00:15:26,142 --> 00:15:27,317
that you show others.

356
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:31,843
Reign will be here soon.
We should get ready.

357
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:38,633
Did you miss me?

358
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:08,445
Sam! Sam, no, this isn't you!

359
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,144
I know you're in there,
I know you are!

360
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,495
No.

361
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:17,150
You really thought
you could stop me, Supergirl?

362
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:20,631
You can't even protect
this one pathetic human.

363
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:21,676
Oh, Sam...

364
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,813
No. But I can.

365
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:32,513
Because this is the tool
I use to bring Reign out
and bury you down.

366
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,123
Come back to us, Sam!

367
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:37,866
I will kill...

368
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:40,521
you all!

369
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:41,522
No, you won't.

370
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:47,528
Sam! Sam!

371
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:49,573
Lena.

372
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:53,012
What happened?

373
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,710
Sam, it's okay. It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

374
00:16:55,753 --> 00:16:57,712
Oh, Sam,
I'm so sorry.

375
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,583
I'm so sorry.

376
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,021
You did it!

377
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,326
You saved Sam.

378
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,894
Yeah, and I did it
without Kryptonite.

379
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:09,767
No!

380
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,511
Fool!

381
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:16,731
I am a Worldkiller.

382
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:19,081
And I cannot be stopped!

383
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:20,735
No!

384
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:35,619
Sam! No! No! No! Sam!

385
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:39,232
No, please!

386
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:40,581
Come back to me, Sam!

387
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,628
Mxy,
they're all dead.

388
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,066
Please, get me out of here.

389
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,421
Lena was never angry
about hypocrisy.

390
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:58,207
She was angry because
I never shared my identity
with her in the first place.

391
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,122
So, you know
what that means?

392
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,950
We have to go back
to the very beginning.

393
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:04,561
Give me a date and a time,
I will make it so.

394
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,085
-Um, let me think.
-Uh...

395
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,086
Hang on a second.

396
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,565
It's just, it's buffering.

397
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:09,740
This happens sometimes.

398
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:11,742
It's the
interdimensional Wi-Fi.

399
00:18:11,786 --> 00:18:13,396
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

400
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,659
I've got your entire friendship
on BetaMyx.

401
00:18:17,183 --> 00:18:20,969
So, when did
the two of you
become friends?

402
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,232
Uh... It... It was...

403
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:25,234
Right after Lena moved
to National City.

404
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:27,149
You have had
a lot of adventures.

405
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,456
"Lena," please.

406
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:30,979
It's good to see you again,
Miss Danvers.

407
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,633
-If I'm calling you "Lena"...
-Kara--

408
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:33,764
- Oh, it's too...
- Anything?

409
00:18:33,808 --> 00:18:35,114
-Too soon.
-Too soon.

410
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,640
I wrote a scathing article
about your device.

411
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:43,122
Mmm... Getting closer. Here.

412
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,167
I would hate for you
to give me these emails

413
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,126
out of some misplaced
sense of friendship.

414
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,780
This was right before
Lena and I
really became friends.

415
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:50,999
See, she's about to say,

416
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:52,827
I didn't come here
to make friends.

417
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,133
She didn't wanna let anyone in,

418
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,438
and then, when she did,

419
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,832
I made the mistake
of not letting her in, too.

420
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,052
This time,
I'm gonna do it right.

421
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,620
Bye!

422
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,325
I didn't come here
to make friends.

423
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,285
I wanna show you something.

424
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:17,634
Listen, I'm really busy,
so, if we could just--

425
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:27,383
It's you.

426
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,345
-Kara Danvers is Supergirl.
-Yeah.

427
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:34,521
Can't believe I was fooled
by a pair of glasses.

428
00:19:34,564 --> 00:19:36,871
Don't worry,
a lot people are.

429
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:39,526
Oh, God,
I have to recall all those
alien detection devices

430
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,049
'cause they clearly don't work.

431
00:19:41,571 --> 00:19:42,659
You're not angry?

432
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,008
No, it's incredible.

433
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,488
I mean, you're incredible!

434
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,533
But...

435
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:50,014
Why are you trusting me
with such a big secret?

436
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,494
You barely know me.

437
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,322
Because I know that
what you want
more than anything

438
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:54,889
is to do good.

439
00:19:54,932 --> 00:19:56,847
And I know it's hard
for you to trust people,

440
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:59,720
but I need you to know now,
without a doubt,

441
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:02,026
I trust you.

442
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,074
My cousin,
your brother,
they got it wrong.

443
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,076
Imagine what we
could do together.

444
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,688
A Luthor and a Super,
working together as a team.

445
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,951
If we were partners,
we could change the world.

446
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,785
Only months after publicly
declaring their partnership,

447
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,092
the formidable duo
of Supergirl and Lena Luthor

448
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,573
has already cleaned up
National City's
criminal element.

449
00:20:26,616 --> 00:20:29,358
This pair is
literally unstoppable!

450
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,099
Not to mention, fashionable

451
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:34,581
after Lena convinced Supergirl
to cut the hair of steel,

452
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:37,105
and gave her
a new suit to boot.

453
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:40,064
But their next adversary
is Lillian Luthor herself,

454
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,893
and this time,
their battleground
is a courtroom.

455
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,374
Emotions. Drama.

456
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:47,550
Will they persevere?

457
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,770
Mxy, can you please
take this seriously?

458
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:52,729
Take it seriously,
because every party
needs a pooper,

459
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:55,428
and that's why
we invited Kara.

460
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,169
Really?

461
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,736
If we're gonna take
the fun out of stuff,
let's really do it.

462
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,913
And what is
Supergirl's real name?

463
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,915
I hardly see
how that's relevant.

464
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,919
Citizens have the right
to know the name of the officer
that arrests them.

465
00:21:08,963 --> 00:21:11,313
If Supergirl is gonna act
like judge and jury,

466
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:12,619
we should know
her name as well.

467
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:15,578
I plead the Fifth.

468
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:16,971
Powerful testimonies

469
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:19,103
in the trial
of Lillian Luthor today.

470
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:21,802
But will they be undercut
by Lena Luthor's refusal

471
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:23,934
to give up
Supergirl's identity?

472
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:26,937
Well, nothing so trifling
as the laws of man

473
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:28,939
could stand
in the way of Supergirl

474
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:31,464
and Lena Luthor's
divine victories!

475
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,205
Where I once thought

476
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,991
that true power was
the Kryptonian
walking amongst us,

477
00:21:37,034 --> 00:21:40,342
but that power is nothing
compared to the might

478
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,824
of a Kryptonian
paired with a Luthor!

479
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,174
This is incredible.

480
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:48,176
The last time
Lillian was on trial,

481
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:50,483
the whole world suspected Lena
of working with her,

482
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,137
-but having Supergirl
as a partner...

483
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:56,489
...it gives Lena
the credibility her last name
never could.

484
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,056
-This is it.
-Yes.

485
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,451
This is the timeline
where I truly
do no harm to Lena,

486
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:05,019
and the world sees her
for the hero she really is.

487
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,151
Of course, I'm more than happy to donate.

488
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,370
Okay.

489
00:22:08,414 --> 00:22:10,198
- Miss Luthor.
- Oh, no.

490
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,634
Is that Lockwood?

491
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:13,506
You knew my father,
Pete Lockwood?

492
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:14,724
You're Ben.

493
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,989
We were sourcing our steel
from his factory,

494
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,469
and then he abruptly closed it.

495
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:23,037
No, he didn't close it.
He converted it to a church.

496
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:25,213
The Cult of Rao.

497
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,476
I'm so sorry, Ben.

498
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,000
If Supergirl and I
can do anything
to help your father--

499
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:30,914
You can't.

500
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:33,352
Because he's dead.

501
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:36,355
My father, my wife,

502
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:39,009
my only son, George,
they jumped off a roof

503
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:42,230
because they believed...

504
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:44,537
that she would save them.

505
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,930
And she didn't.

506
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,281
I'm so sorry, Ben.

507
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:53,023
If there's anything
I could do to help--

508
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,590
Well, you could tell me
who Supergirl is.

509
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,028
She parades around as a god,

510
00:22:58,072 --> 00:23:01,554
but she hides in plain sight
as a human.

511
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:07,429
Miss Luthor, if...
if people knew who she was,

512
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,214
if they knew
that she bought a coffee
in the morning

513
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:14,044
or that she rode the bus
or that she worked a job
just like the rest of us,

514
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,264
then they would stop
worshipping her.

515
00:23:19,746 --> 00:23:22,401
So, I have to know who she is.

516
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:27,144
And you are going to tell me.

517
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,190
It's never gonna happen.

518
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,280
And if you have issues
with the Cult of Rao,

519
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,282
I suggest you take it up
with Coville.

520
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,284
Oh... I already have.

521
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,291
Hiya!

522
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,909
Thomas Coville
wants you to believe

523
00:23:52,953 --> 00:23:56,435
that National City's
resident Kryptonian
is someone worth worshipping,

524
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,784
worth dying for.

525
00:23:57,827 --> 00:23:59,829
Is Supergirl a god?

526
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:03,093
I'm not sure about that.

527
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:04,573
Not sure about that.

528
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:06,009
When she goes home at night,

529
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:09,752
did you know
that she lives
a secret human life?

530
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,798
Until today.

531
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:17,586
Until today, because today,
Supergirl will reveal
her identity to the world,

532
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,502
or... Coville
and Miss Luthor will die.

533
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,112
No. Supergirl, don't do it!

534
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:25,638
So, Supergirl, one hour
of breathable oxygen left,

535
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:26,769
the clock starts now.

536
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,167
What're you gonna do?
Uh... No spoilers.

537
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,648
I'm loving this.
Uh, I mean...

538
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,128
I can't trace
the signal.

539
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:40,609
Look, some lone wolf
shouldn't have the resources
to thwart our trackers.

540
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,002
He must have powerful help.

541
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,612
Yeah, help spelled L-E-X.

542
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:46,310
If that's the case,
then we are
never gonna find her.

543
00:24:50,227 --> 00:24:51,359
Stay here, I got it.

544
00:24:56,233 --> 00:24:58,235
Every morning
when I wake up...

545
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:00,760
I imagine this moment.

546
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:06,374
The moment where
being Supergirl gets
someone I love killed.

547
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,855
And I have push that fear
so far down...

548
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,554
...or I... I can't
get out of bed.

549
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,688
But now, here it is.

550
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,866
My greatest fear,
just staring me
right in the face.

551
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:24,174
I have to save Lena.

552
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:27,656
I... I have to,
but if I tell the world
who I am,

553
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,703
then I put everyone else I love
at even greater risk.

554
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:34,010
Alex, J'onn, James, you.

555
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,664
What if one of you gets hurt?

556
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:38,232
Don't worry about
the rest of us, okay?

557
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:39,755
We're gonna be fine.

558
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,844
No, Lena is the one
that needs your help
right now.

559
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,542
We can take care
of ourselves...

560
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,240
because you taught us how.

561
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:49,678
We're here
at National City Hall,

562
00:25:49,722 --> 00:25:52,202
where Supergirl is set
to arrive any minute,

563
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:55,292
and announce her human identity
to the world.

564
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:03,126
-Oh, sorry.
-Jeez. You're strong.

565
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:07,304
Hello.

566
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,132
Hello.

567
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:11,961
I am Kara Danvers.

568
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:17,924
Some of you may know me
as a reporter
for CatCo Worldwide Media.

569
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:21,405
-But I am also...

570
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:23,582
Kara Zor-El, of Krypton.

571
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,715
I am Supergirl.

572
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,112
Good stuff, my dude!

573
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:36,595
But we should kill
the hostages anyway, right?

574
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,771
No.

575
00:26:38,814 --> 00:26:40,468
No, we keep our word.

576
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:42,122
Send them the location.

577
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,956
Are you okay?

578
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,134
Just breathe, Lena. It's okay.

579
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,790
Maybe it's time
the world knows.

580
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,448
I've always been
so afraid to reveal
my identity to the world,

581
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:06,799
but look, it saved Lena.

582
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,149
Maybe...

583
00:27:10,803 --> 00:27:12,282
Just maybe, this...

584
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,807
this is the timeline
to stick with. Let's...

585
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:18,506
I see why
you would think that,

586
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:20,987
but, um, maybe
we should skip ahead
to the ending?

587
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:23,076
Oh, no, what happens?

588
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:25,339
After Supergirl's identity
was released to the world,

589
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:28,951
Agent Liberty
and his followers targeted
each of Supergirl's friends,

590
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,953
including her former
employer Cat Grant...

591
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:31,998
-No.
-...one by one.

592
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,000
There were no survivors.

593
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:36,219
-All right, all right,
enough. Stop.
-Alex Danvers, Winn Schott...

594
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:37,307
-I don't wanna see anymore.
Please turn it off, please.
-...J'onn J'onzz...

595
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:44,532
It doesn't matter
when I tell Lena the truth.

596
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:46,534
It always makes things worse.

597
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:52,366
I think I've been
too scared to admit it
to myself, but...

598
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:58,677
I think Lena would
be better off if she and I
were never friends.

599
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:01,201
Is that the world
you wanna see?

600
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,202
No.

601
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,424
Please just show me anyway.

602
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,213
What happened?

603
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:16,564
Where are we?

604
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:19,567
Where your loft used to be.

605
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:21,569
Uh...

606
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:27,357
You know what? No thanks.

607
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:28,968
-Nope. I don't need to see it.
-Yeah.

608
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,883
-Can you just
snap us out of here?
-Yep. With pleasure.

609
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:38,412
What's happening?

610
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:42,764
I can't feel
the Fifth Dimension at all.

611
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:45,549
Without my powers--

612
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:46,420
We're stuck here?

613
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:58,606
We should get out of here.

614
00:28:58,649 --> 00:28:59,476
You think?

615
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:07,746
Citizens,
you're out after curfew,
in defiance of Luthor Law.

616
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,101
This world sucks!

617
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,111
You don't know the half of it.

618
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,767
Look who I found.

619
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:32,118
Oh, Kara,
thank God you're here.

620
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,467
Who's this?

621
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,904
Oh, this is
my friend, Mxyzptlk.

622
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,601
-Mxyzptlk?
- Yeah.

623
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:38,777
What, you thought
with the new face,

624
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,083
we wouldn't recognize
the same old you?

625
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:43,259
This is the guy who tried
to make Kara marry him.

626
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,784
It's fine, Mon-El.
Because he is reformed...

627
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:47,481
and he's actually helping me.

628
00:29:47,524 --> 00:29:50,789
Uh, no... You know what?
No, Mon-El is right. Okay?

629
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,139
It was despicable of me
to pursue a woman

630
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:56,098
who so clearly
was not interested in me
from the get-go.

631
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,709
I misread the room,
and I'm gonna be better.

632
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,625
It's tough to be an imp.

633
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,454
And I'm gonna try
for the rest of my days.

634
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,021
So, maybe we can let
the past be the past, huh?

635
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:08,110
Come on.

636
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:10,634
Wow. Okay, you won.

637
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:11,810
We'll need all the help
we can get.

638
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,594
All right, well,

639
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:16,858
look... things are not
as they seem,
and I will explain, but...

640
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:19,295
First, will someone
please tell me
what's going on here?

641
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,125
People of National City,

642
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,867
I regret to inform you
that the terrorist
known as Supergirl

643
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,261
-is at large.
-Terrorist?

644
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:31,655
She's working with
a Fifth Dimensional being,
capable of mass destruction.

645
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,136
H.O.P.E. Robots have
been deployed throughout
the city for your protection.

646
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,574
Please, report to them any
and all suspicious activity.

647
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,664
And remember...

648
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,232
My goal is,
as it has always been...

649
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,974
to protect you from harm.

650
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:47,541
No.

651
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,717
When Lena first came
to National City...

652
00:30:51,023 --> 00:30:52,676
to take over L-Corp,

653
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,504
Lex tried
to have her assassinated.

654
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,984
He failed,

655
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,508
but she was seriously injured
in the attack.

656
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:01,033
She disappeared for two years.

657
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,513
When she came back,
everybody said that
she was different,

658
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,863
that she had changed.

659
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,560
The trauma,
the loneliness...

660
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,867
it drove her mad.

661
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:11,565
She retaliated against Lex,
killed him.

662
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:14,046
Took half of National City
along with her.

663
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:16,570
Now, she rules what's left
with an iron fist.

664
00:31:16,613 --> 00:31:19,051
-Reign is her enforcer.
-And Brainy, too.

665
00:31:19,094 --> 00:31:20,922
She captured him. Aligned him.

666
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,924
Now, he has no emotions...

667
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,014
and does whatever
Lena tells him to.

668
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,320
Oh, no.

669
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:29,235
This, this... I have made
a terrible mistake.

670
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,194
This world
is my responsibility.

671
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,370
Okay. Okay,
we can still fix this.

672
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:35,589
- I need
my powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

673
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:36,895
But since we've been here...

674
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,679
They've disappeared.

675
00:31:38,722 --> 00:31:41,725
That must be because
Lena tapped into
the Fifth Dimensional energy

676
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:43,814
to use it to power
her police robots.

677
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:46,730
And as long as she's
harnessing the Fifth Dimension,
then you can't access it.

678
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:49,211
I worked at L-Corp
for about two years
before Lena found me out.

679
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,734
Uh, we caught a criminal.

680
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,214
He didn't have a name,
but he had a hat

681
00:31:52,258 --> 00:31:53,215
that he could
pull anything out of.

682
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:54,782
Old drinking buddy of mine.

683
00:31:54,825 --> 00:31:56,610
I lost that hat to him
in a poker game.

684
00:31:56,653 --> 00:32:00,222
That hat contains a lot
of Fifth Dimensional magic.

685
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,571
So, if we get you the hat...

686
00:32:01,615 --> 00:32:04,313
Get me the hat,
I can make all of this go...

687
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,315
-bye-bye.

688
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,116
Surrender the imp or die!

689
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:32,298
Get the hat!

690
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,431
We'll hold her off!

691
00:32:35,475 --> 00:32:37,129
Come on,
I'll show you the way!

692
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,695
And I've got your back!

693
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,318
Brainy, it's me.

694
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:55,843
It's Nia.

695
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,280
You don't have to do this.

696
00:32:58,324 --> 00:33:00,543
I know I don't have to.

697
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,983
But I think I will enjoy it.

698
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,347
Go to Lena, I've got Reign.

699
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,710
Lena?

700
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,538
It's me.

701
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:41,541
It's Supergirl.

702
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:45,719
It's Kara.

703
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,026
Who's Kara?

704
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:54,902
Just a friend.

705
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,906
You don't know me.

706
00:33:59,428 --> 00:34:00,429
Not really.

707
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:03,911
But you and I want
the same thing...

708
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:07,741
to do no harm.

709
00:34:07,784 --> 00:34:09,917
Supergirl wants a world
without harm.

710
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:13,703
That's rich.

711
00:34:13,747 --> 00:34:17,272
Where were you
when my brother blew
my helicopter out of the sky?

712
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:23,235
When my mother dragged
my broken body to a laboratory

713
00:34:23,278 --> 00:34:25,585
and experimented on me
instead of fixing me?

714
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:31,112
Where were you
when this world was
ripped apart by the seams?

715
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:32,766
Where were you?

716
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,594
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when it mattered.

717
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,118
So am I.

718
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,452
The hat's in this room.
I can feel it.

719
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:21,293
It's J'onn.

720
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,512
-He needs our help.
-No, he needs this.

721
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,820
Time to face justice,
Manhunter.

722
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,651
J'onn! Catch!

723
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,136
Dreamer, do it now!

724
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:12,213
You don't know
the first thing about pain.

725
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:15,912
But I do. I can show you,
make you feel what I feel.

726
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:19,089
I won't fight you, Lena.

727
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:24,704
Then you'll die screaming.

728
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,193
Found it.

729
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:46,726
We're home.

730
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:53,036
Holy cow!

731
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,039
That was the most
emotionally draining
experience of my life,

732
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,738
and let me tell ya,
I've had some doozies.

733
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:01,871
Okay. So, it ain't over
till it's over.

734
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:04,091
So, now,
we've gotta find a time

735
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:07,225
for you to go back
and tell Lena the truth.

736
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:08,617
-You ready for one more go?
-No.

737
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:12,230
No. Absolutely not!

738
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:16,408
I realize now
that it doesn't matter
when I tell Lena the truth.

739
00:37:16,451 --> 00:37:18,932
There will always
be consequences.

740
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,368
Huge ones.

741
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:22,762
And if I can't go back
and snap my mistakes away,

742
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,546
I'm just gonna
have to live with them.

743
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,808
-Oh...

744
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,898
Oh...

745
00:37:28,942 --> 00:37:30,248
-Oh, boy.

746
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,772
Okay.

747
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:35,601
I know it didn't turn out
the way we expected,
but you...

748
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,777
You still helped me, Mxy.

749
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:41,781
You freed me
from my burden of guilt, so...

750
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:45,611
-Go, be free.
-Ah.

751
00:37:45,654 --> 00:37:49,397
Use your magic to do
whatever it is you do.

752
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:50,268
Thank you.

753
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:51,617
Um...

754
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:54,924
And I should say, uh...

755
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,796
Before I met you,
I was, um...

756
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,451
I was pretty lonely.

757
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:03,629
You know, and in that pain,
I... I would tend to sort of,
force myself...

758
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:05,152
on people, and, uh...

759
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,287
Out there with you today,

760
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:10,984
saving the world,
I felt like, um...

761
00:38:12,464 --> 00:38:16,294
I felt like I was liked,
for being me.

762
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:17,295
I felt like I had friends.

763
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:19,340
And, uh...

764
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:21,864
it's true
what you said, Kara.

765
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:24,476
That magic...

766
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:26,478
can't be forced.

767
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,480
It has to be found.

768
00:38:31,831 --> 00:38:33,006
I'm proud of you, Mxy.

769
00:38:34,703 --> 00:38:35,835
Thanks for everything.

770
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:38,707
You're welcome.

771
00:38:42,189 --> 00:38:44,191
Now, if you'll excuse me,

772
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:46,541
I'm off to Mardi Gras
in the '80s.

773
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:49,892
The 1780s.

774
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,235
Let me guess...

775
00:39:28,278 --> 00:39:30,890
You're here to
tell me once again
that I should forgive you.

776
00:39:32,544 --> 00:39:35,677
Or maybe that I shouldn't
work with my brother?

777
00:39:35,721 --> 00:39:36,591
Not this time.

778
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:39,420
I recognize I made a mistake

779
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,683
in hiding my identity
from you for so long,

780
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,556
but the past is the past,
and I can't change it.

781
00:39:45,774 --> 00:39:48,690
Forgive me or not,
that's your choice.

782
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:52,085
Just like it's your choice
to work with Lex.

783
00:39:52,128 --> 00:39:54,566
I'm done blaming myself
for your bad decisions.

784
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,439
Then why are you here?

785
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,574
To tell you that
from now on,

786
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:04,445
you're accountable
for your own actions.

787
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:09,407
If you decide to forgive me,
I will be there for you.

788
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:12,279
But if you continue
to work with Lex...

789
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:16,457
If you go through
with whatever it is
the two of you are planning,

790
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,459
I will do everything
in my power to stop you...

791
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,289
just like I would
any other villain.

792
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:37,478
This is an extraordinary
amount of food.

793
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,915
A parting gift from Mxy.

794
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:42,440
Well, I think
we should have Mxy
here more often.

795
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,096
I hear
Fifth Dimensional interventions

796
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,576
do wonders
for one's perspective.

797
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,577
You know what?

798
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:52,450
Actually, they really do.

799
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:56,149
Seeing all those
alternate versions of reality
made me realize,

800
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:59,108
second-guessing myself
doesn't do any good.

801
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,588
No.

802
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:03,025
So, if I make a mistake,
I just have to move on.

803
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,163
What is that smile?

804
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,470
You guys.

805
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:16,038
Guys, you've been
with me from...

806
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,172
the second I became Supergirl.

807
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:25,831
In my best moments
and especially
my worst moments.

808
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,488
That means the world to me.

809
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:32,402
Sames.

810
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:34,230
Back at you.

811
00:41:37,233 --> 00:41:38,321
El-may-arah.

812
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:39,235
-Aw.

813
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:41,368
"Stronger together."

814
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,980
-Potato.
-Po-tah-to.
