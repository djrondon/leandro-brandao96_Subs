1
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:20,020
Foul beast.
Plague of my family.

2
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,196
Today your life ends.

3
00:00:29,768 --> 00:00:31,205
End simulation.

4
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,690
These new Obsidian Platinum
lenses are amazing!

5
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:41,389
Well, Kelly said the upgrade
is so realistic that people

6
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:44,914
can actually touch and taste
and smell things in the VR.

7
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:48,396
I mean, look at that guy.
He's actually feeling like
he's going that fast.

8
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,571
He must be fearless.

9
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:51,181
That would make
even me dizzy.

10
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,878
Oh, hardly.

11
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:56,708
But fearless
is definitely something
I wish I was feeling,

12
00:00:56,752 --> 00:00:59,407
'cause right now,
being out in this crowd,

13
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,235
I don't like it
without my sidearm.

14
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:05,239
I can't believe Lex
made you give up your gun
when you left the DEO.

15
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:08,242
This is the first time
in eight years I've been
out without it.

16
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:12,942
You know what? I love it.
You and J'onn, The Tower,
without bureaucracy.

17
00:01:12,985 --> 00:01:16,076
Without an evil overlord
holding you back.

18
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,555
I think it's great.

19
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,602
-Hi.
-Hi. Oh, my gosh!

20
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:23,561
-Look at this place.
It's amazing!
-It's all Andrea.

21
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:26,738
Well, okay, sure. Maybe
the pizzazz part, but I mean,

22
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:30,133
not the upgraded 150
petaflop bio-link interface.

23
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,787
She has never said
words like that.

24
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,746
Oh, you are paying attention
to my late night ramblings.

25
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,923
-I do listen. Yes.
-More importantly,
what's in the box?

26
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:40,926
This is a first day gift
for my awesome girlfriend.

27
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,407
Hot pockets,
macaroni and cheese

28
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,235
and your favorite
dumplings from Wang Foo's.

29
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,759
-Dumplings?
-Oh, no. Hey. Uh-uh.

30
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:50,240
This is comfort food for me.

31
00:01:50,284 --> 00:01:53,635
-I might share with J'onn.
Maybe. If he asks.
-What?

32
00:01:53,678 --> 00:01:55,941
-I've been listen...
-Um, don't look now

33
00:01:55,985 --> 00:01:59,249
but the co-worker you rejected
is coming this way.

34
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,772
-Don't look now.
-Oh.

35
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:03,427
-Oh. You should do your thing.
-I gotta go to The Tower.

36
00:02:03,471 --> 00:02:06,474
-We have a thing
that we have to do.
-Traitors. Traitors!

37
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:07,475
-Hi!
-Morning!

38
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:08,606
Hello.

39
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,608
-I come bearing lattes.
-Oh.

40
00:02:10,652 --> 00:02:13,176
-Sugar-free vanilla latte.
-Thank you.

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,138
And for you, double caff,
double foam
with caramel and mocha.

42
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,269
How did you know that?

43
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:20,792
I'm an
investigative journalist.

44
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:23,186
But don't we all know
our friends' orders by heart?

45
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,797
This was very thoughtful
of you, thank you.

46
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,843
-It was nothing.
See you guys there.
-Bye.

47
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,672
-Bye.
-Wow.

48
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:34,023
Rejection never looked so good
or was so cool about it.

49
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,634
Why am I so bad at this?

50
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:38,941
At 9:00 p.m. tonight,

51
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:42,684
Obsidian will change
the way you think
and feel and experience life.

52
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:45,730
The countdown to your
dreams starts now.

53
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:55,871
Eleven hours and counting.
Exclamation point,
exclamation point.

54
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:04,706
Help! Help!

55
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,195
Are you okay?

56
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,022
I am now.

57
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,198
Thank you for saving me.

58
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:21,331
What the hell happened?

59
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,680
Someone tried
to kill you.

60
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,682
-How did you know?
-Because of this.

61
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,206
It was delivered
five minutes ago.

62
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,208
It's an Anti-Obsidian
manifesto.

63
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:31,515
"Obsidian North
is technological genocide.

64
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:35,040
With Andrea Rojas now dead,
consider this
your final warning.

65
00:03:35,084 --> 00:03:37,608
Cancel the Obsidian Platinum
launch or more will die."

66
00:03:39,958 --> 00:03:43,919
He can threaten
whatever he wants.
I will not postpone.

67
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,076
Well, isn't that cute?

68
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,645
I wasn't aware
a Maladorian Dendroasp
could show any restraint.

69
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,302
-And you two share
a lot in common.
-Hmm.

70
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,913
Non Nocere does
what God couldn't.

71
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:25,613
Turns the most ferocious animal
instincts into "do no harm."

72
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:29,573
So far, all of your
animal trials have
produced perfect results.

73
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,619
Yeah, but the human brain
is far more complex

74
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,273
and I've yet to test it
to see that it's working

75
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:34,926
just as perfectly.

76
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,451
Can't have any critics
pouncing on any mistakes.

77
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:41,455
Hmm. That has a bit
of a personal ring to it.

78
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:45,981
Let me guess. Your biggest
critic is a Kryptonian?

79
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:48,940
Before Crisis, when I tried to
use Myriad, she assumed that

80
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:51,595
I was trying
to mind control people.

81
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,163
Her and her friends think
I'm going down a dark path.

82
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,947
They think
you've turned into me.

83
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,775
Or at least, Mother.

84
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:00,822
But you haven't... tragically.

85
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,346
Can you imagine what it would
be like if humanity didn't

86
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,435
succumb to terror,
rage and worry?

87
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:08,003
We would be the best
versions of ourselves.

88
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:10,962
-Be creative. Be free--
-Utopia.

89
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:13,617
Exactly. But Supergirl and her
friends just can't accept that

90
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:16,490
I don't want to
puppet master humanity.

91
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:20,363
Since I anticipated
you being ready for
the next phase of testing,

92
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:26,151
I took the liberty of setting
up a trial at that cute little
prison we own.

93
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:30,634
Willing subjects waiting for
a chance to be better people.

94
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,244
There's a car waiting
for you downstairs.

95
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,511
Gotta go. Duty calls.

96
00:05:41,515 --> 00:05:43,473
Got your text.

97
00:05:43,517 --> 00:05:46,650
Good news on inverting
Toyman's Immortality Code
for use against Leviathan?

98
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:50,350
Yes. I'm nearly done
re-purposing the code
to render Leviathan vulnerable,

99
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:52,830
but seeing as how they are
a techno-organic species

100
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:55,398
from the same
solar system as Krypton,

101
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,357
I've calculated that it would
be next to impossible

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,010
to inject
the code into their skin

103
00:05:59,054 --> 00:06:02,187
without first, somehow,
weakening them.

104
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:03,493
So, are you saying
we would need to find

105
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,539
their version of Kryptonite?

106
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,367
In so many words, yes.

107
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,629
Then no.

108
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:10,021
I've been down that road
and let's just say,

109
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:11,371
I didn't win.

110
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:15,244
There is one
intriguing possibility.

111
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:18,247
but that would require
access to Leviathan's
base of operations.

112
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,292
Which we don't even know
the location of.

113
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:22,686
Sir.

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,080
There's been an attack
on Andrea Rojas.

115
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,910
Despite a vicious attack,

116
00:06:28,953 --> 00:06:30,912
Andrea Rojas promised that

117
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:33,697
the launch will proceed
as planned
at 9:00 p.m. tonight...

118
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,046
This is terrible.

119
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,526
Or fortuitous.

120
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,746
We need to get closer
to Leviathan

121
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,095
so that we can
find their home base

122
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,053
to administer
the Mortality Code.

123
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:45,274
Gemma Cooper is heavily
invested in both Andrea
and the launch,

124
00:06:45,317 --> 00:06:47,232
which will need protection.

125
00:06:47,276 --> 00:06:49,887
What better way
to get in with Leviathan

126
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,324
than to protect
their favorite child?

127
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,718
Call Supergirl.

128
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,721
I am not a bodyguard, Lex.

129
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,463
With you guarding her,
there is a 99.7% chance

130
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:03,248
that Andrea survives
and her assailant is captured.

131
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:06,556
Well, instead, why doesn't
the DEO track the terrorists

132
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,905
before they attack again?

133
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,254
When I rescued her
this morning,

134
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:11,474
there was pink energy
surrounding the elevator.

135
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:14,434
Pink energy would suggest
a Chlorophyllian.

136
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:16,566
And their energy
is impossible to track.

137
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,135
Finding them before
the launch tonight
seems unlikely.

138
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,792
And if you refuse, you know
the leverage I have.

139
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:27,142
Not to mention you'll have
the blood of a poor,

140
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:29,274
innocent billionaire
on your hands.

141
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,755
Platinum lets you be
whomever you want,

142
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,627
whenever you want.

143
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,763
We have more cases
than I care to count.

144
00:07:39,807 --> 00:07:42,287
Runaway aliens,
missing persons,

145
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,812
and... the odd wayward spouse.

146
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:48,293
And still no leads
on what Lex is up to.

147
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,818
We will get to the bottom
of that, I promise you.

148
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,386
Are you okay?

149
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,477
I've had a clear mission

150
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,783
and a boss to answer to

151
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:02,482
every day of my life
since medical school.

152
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,833
And now,
with all this freedom,

153
00:08:05,876 --> 00:08:08,488
-I'm just starting
to feel a little--
-Discombobulated.

154
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:09,793
Yes.

155
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,666
-Hey.
-Hey.

156
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,798
Lex just personally
assigned me

157
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,191
to bodyguard Andrea Rojas

158
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:17,801
until Platinum's launch
tonight.

159
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,020
Bodyguard?

160
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,804
Why does Lex care so much
about the launch?

161
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:23,633
Exactly. He must have
an ulterior motive
against Obsidian.

162
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,330
Or it's a trap.

163
00:08:25,374 --> 00:08:28,203
Well, either way,
I'll investigate
when I'm with Andrea,

164
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:30,510
but I came here first
to see if you guys could help.

165
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,163
Do you have any idea
who attacked Andrea?

166
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:35,340
I saw pink energy
in the elevator
while it was falling.

167
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,691
And Brainy says
it could be Chlorophyllian,

168
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,563
but he also said their energy
is impossible to track, so...

169
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,652
Chlorophyllians are
a peaceful race.

170
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,393
They absorb sunlight
through their dermis

171
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,003
in order to super-grow crops.

172
00:08:46,047 --> 00:08:49,050
They shouldn't be able
to siphon off
electrical energy.

173
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,356
Still, it's a lead.

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,836
We'll get on it.

175
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,099
Well, if you need me
I'll be glued
to Andrea's side.

176
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:06,023
You're a difficult woman
to track down.

177
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,374
You being here
blocking my way
would suggest otherwise.

178
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:11,159
I heard the terrible news.

179
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,683
How perplexing
that terrorists were able
to breach your security.

180
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,207
And you want to "help" me.

181
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,209
How thoughtful.

182
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,907
On such a momentous day
for your company

183
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,213
I feel it's my civic duty.

184
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,693
What could you
possibly give us

185
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,390
that we can't give ourselves?

186
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:26,740
Supergirl...

187
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,263
For Andrea Rojas's protection.

188
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:32,093
I don't need your Supergirl,
nor do I want her.

189
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:34,095
Oh, I think you do.

190
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:36,576
I know you prefer yourpeople

191
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:39,056
to not be in the public eye,

192
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,146
and, well, this launch... Wow.
Talk about the headlines.

193
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:46,063
And if you know my people,

194
00:09:46,107 --> 00:09:48,065
you know what I can do
to a yappy little dog

195
00:09:48,109 --> 00:09:49,240
that nips at my heel.

196
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,242
That's why I adore you.

197
00:09:51,286 --> 00:09:54,115
I can give you something
you value above all else...

198
00:09:54,158 --> 00:09:55,899
anonymity.

199
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,119
The entire world will be
watching and recording

200
00:09:58,162 --> 00:10:01,252
Andrea Rojas' every move
until the launch at 9:00 p.m.

201
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:04,255
Given the high-profile nature
of the situation,

202
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:05,648
I'm the easy choice.

203
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:09,434
I do admire your confidence,
Mr. Luthor.

204
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,654
Always the over-achiever.

205
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,525
I'll call off my friends.

206
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:22,447
But be forewarned,
we don't give second chances.

207
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:24,972
So don't make promises
you can't keep.

208
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,331
All of these men volunteered?

209
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,854
They did.

210
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,117
It's a cross section
of inmates
from the most violent

211
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,989
to those who are afraid
of their own shadow.

212
00:10:44,861 --> 00:10:46,297
What are you looking at?

213
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,995
Nothing, nothing.
I'm sorry, Toby.

214
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:49,866
Guards!

215
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,218
Are you all right?

216
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:57,657
It's nothing.

217
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,310
That was practically
a high five,

218
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,530
considering what he does
to me most days.

219
00:11:01,573 --> 00:11:02,792
How do you cope?

220
00:11:02,836 --> 00:11:04,664
It's prison.

221
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:06,491
Guys like me
don't stand a chance.

222
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:08,493
Five years in here
taught me that.

223
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:12,019
But maybe after your trials,

224
00:11:12,062 --> 00:11:14,804
I won't have to worry.

225
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:17,024
I've heard you're trying
to turn them

226
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,808
peaceful as Quakers.

227
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:20,984
If you succeed,

228
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:24,858
that'd be a real godsend
for guys like me, Lena Luthor.

229
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:27,861
Let's get started.

230
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,169
Thank you for seeing
how important this is

231
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,823
and having my back.

232
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,259
With you by my side,

233
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:36,870
people will be
even more amped
for the launch.

234
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,523
Selfie?

235
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,047
Uh...

236
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,223
Hashtag SuperGuard.

237
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,878
When is everyone
getting here?

238
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,444
I cancelled the live audience.

239
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:48,838
I won't risk innocent lives.

240
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:50,710
And I won't give in to terror.

241
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:52,233
Andrea!

242
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,190
Natalia.

243
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:55,192
Oh, my God, how are you?

244
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,585
You must still be shaking.

245
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:58,282
Oh, better now that I'm here.

246
00:11:59,893 --> 00:12:01,372
Pleasure to meet you,
Supergirl.

247
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,765
William Dey.

248
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,549
-We crossed paths this morning.
-Uh, yeah, yes.

249
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:08,553
It's very nice to meet you...
formally.

250
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,859
What are you doing here?

251
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:12,079
I'm covering the Obsidian
North Platinum launch,

252
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:14,037
and this is the first stop
on the press tour.

253
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,258
You're following Andrea
around all day?

254
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:20,783
Well, if someone attacks,
you could get hurt, or killed.

255
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:21,915
I'm a journalist.

256
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,220
We put ourselves
in harm's way

257
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,569
to show our readers
the truth.

258
00:12:24,613 --> 00:12:25,745
How can I shy away
from danger

259
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,790
when the people I cover can't?

260
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:29,052
That's very heroic.

261
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:32,403
Ah, I don't know about that,
but thank you.

262
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,579
It's also a huge story.

263
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,233
For better or worse,

264
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:37,757
this launch
is the biggest thing

265
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,628
since the invention
of the computer.

266
00:12:41,108 --> 00:12:42,631
Harry!

267
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,459
-J'onn J'onzz!
-Hey, man.

268
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:45,765
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

269
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:46,809
What are you up to?

270
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,811
We're looking for
a Chlorophyllian.

271
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:49,769
You know any?

272
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:51,814
Can't say that I do.

273
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,817
But Dmitry over there,

274
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,298
he knows everybody.
Might be worth a shot.

275
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,778
-Thanks, man.
-Thanks.

276
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,130
Hey, man.

277
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:04,653
You!

278
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,437
Get away from me.

279
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,612
You two know each other?

280
00:13:07,656 --> 00:13:09,266
I might've roughed him up
once or twice

281
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,790
while tracking a lead.

282
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,835
It's not the arm-twisting
I'm worried about,

283
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:14,619
it's the jail time
I did afterward

284
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:15,838
that I'd like to avoid.

285
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,493
Look, we're not here
to arrest you. Okay?

286
00:13:18,536 --> 00:13:20,277
I don't work for
the government anymore.

287
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:21,496
We're gonna need your help.

288
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,933
Look, we're looking for
a Chlorophyllian.

289
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,500
Somebody with tech issues

290
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,545
or possibly
an anger management
problem.

291
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:37,164
I have a buddy
who engages in certain...

292
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:40,167
less than legal
weapons transactions.

293
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,646
He mentioned a Chlorophyllian

294
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,345
asking about
some military-grade tech.

295
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:47,478
The Chlorophyllian...
any ideas where
we can find him?

296
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,003
My buddy was complaining
about making the trek out

297
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:51,961
to a farmhouse on Route 89.

298
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,180
Thank you.

299
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:57,314
And I... I'm sorry
about last time.

300
00:13:57,358 --> 00:13:59,839
-She's sorry. Thanks.
-Yeah.

301
00:13:59,882 --> 00:14:02,842
This sounds
really bad, J'onn.

302
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,713
I'm gonna call Brainy
and see what he can find.

303
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,323
You sure that's wise?

304
00:14:06,367 --> 00:14:08,978
If Lex finds out
Brainy's using
DEO resources for you,

305
00:14:09,022 --> 00:14:10,762
it could put him
in Lex's crosshairs.

306
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,329
-He's family. He'll let us
know if he can't.

307
00:14:14,418 --> 00:14:15,985
Brainy, hey.
We got a lead.

308
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,769
That's excellent news.

309
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,859
Can you see if there's
a Chlorophyllian living off
of Route 89?

310
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:21,338
It's some kind of farm.

311
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,863
I just need a name, address...
anything you can get.

312
00:14:27,736 --> 00:14:29,042
Unfortunately,
I see no record

313
00:14:29,085 --> 00:14:31,218
of any Chlorophyllians
living in that vicinity.

314
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:33,350
In fact, the only farm
off Route 89

315
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,396
has been liquidated
with no proof
of asset dispersion.

316
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,398
Okay, thanks, Brainy.

317
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:39,008
No dice.

318
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:41,358
Ah, look, I still want
to track down that farm.

319
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,751
Yeah, agreed.

320
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:58,767
I apologize for
the intrusion.

321
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,203
I'm here to help.

322
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,250
Lex must ingratiate
himself with Gemma Cooper

323
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,034
in order to defeat Leviathan.

324
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,037
For that to happen,
Supergirl must save
Andrea Rojas.

325
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:11,084
Therefore, Alex Danvers
and J'onn J'onzz need to be
left in the dark.

326
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:12,737
I've done the calculations.

327
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:16,393
There is
a 93.2% probability that

328
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:18,613
none will invite me
to Thanksgiving...

329
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,442
after I do what must be done.

330
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,620
Yes, well, that is a quite
the conundrum, Querl.

331
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,233
Alas, in a moment like this,

332
00:15:30,277 --> 00:15:32,235
there is only one thing
you can do.

333
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,584
Trust the math.

334
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:38,938
Your ultimate allegiance
must remain with Lex.

335
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:42,767
Only then, will the future
unfold the way we need it to.

336
00:15:42,811 --> 00:15:44,639
Trust that your friends
are strong.

337
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:47,468
I mean, they areheroes,
after all.

338
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:52,255
And that is quantifiable.

339
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,431
I desperately hope
you're right.

340
00:15:54,475 --> 00:15:57,347
Man, that is a nice haircut.

341
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:59,697
Shut up.

342
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:06,617
Non Nocere program
uploading.

343
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:08,315
Let's see if this works.

344
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,493
Gentlemen, stand
and remove your lenses.

345
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:20,544
Yo, Steve, come here.

346
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,160
Do you wanna grab
some grub?

347
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,468
Uh, sure, Toby...

348
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,470
That would be lovely.

349
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:34,515
Yeah.

350
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:41,348
You're a genius.

351
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:46,875
...as a testament to the people
who are standing up
to these threats.

352
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,050
What do you make of all this?

353
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,661
How do you mean?

354
00:16:50,705 --> 00:16:53,316
The culprit, the manifesto,
the whole situation?

355
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,101
Off the record, of course.

356
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:58,191
I think it's horrible.
People should never
resort to violence.

357
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,846
-But...
-I hate to say it,

358
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,502
but I think the manifesto
makes some slightly
decent points.

359
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:09,854
I mean, not that
"Obsidian Lenses will take
our sentient minds hostage."

360
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:13,510
But that people
disconnecting from
the real world

361
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:17,166
could backfire
in unforeseen ways,

362
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,429
creating irreparable damage.

363
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,390
What do you think?

364
00:17:24,391 --> 00:17:26,219
The way I look at it,

365
00:17:26,262 --> 00:17:28,047
Obsidian North's
biggest appeal is that

366
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,180
it taps into people's desire
to feel connected.

367
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,053
And when you
only live in that VR world,

368
00:17:34,096 --> 00:17:37,752
you end up getting
further and further away
from the real world.

369
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:41,408
You've thought a lot
about this.

370
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:44,759
When the first generation
lenses dropped, I was buzzing.

371
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:48,545
I thought about being able
to hang with my buddy
who I lost a few years ago.

372
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,373
But it wasn't until
I hung out with my friend,

373
00:17:50,417 --> 00:17:52,201
or, co-worker, Kara,

374
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:57,424
that I remembered what
being really connected
feels like.

375
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,209
All it took was some karaoke
and a game night.

376
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:04,953
But I realized
I didn't want to live in
some perfect VR world,

377
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:07,434
I just wanted to be with
the people I care about.

378
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,969
Andrea Rojas!

379
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,421
Ms. Rojas, we need to
get you to a secure location.

380
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:40,206
I am not running away.

381
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,946
You were just attacked
by someone who can
travel through light.

382
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,428
Then it's good
that saving people
is what you do best.

383
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:48,127
And Obsidian...
It's what I do best.

384
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:51,478
It's my life.

385
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:54,829
It's my father's, too.

386
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:01,531
This company
is his life's work.

387
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,970
Mi papábuilt it
from the ground up.

388
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,147
He sacrificed everything,
and...

389
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,457
...and so did I.

390
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,286
I've done things to help him
restore Obsidian to glory.

391
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,158
Things I'm not proud of,

392
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:22,030
and things I can never undo.

393
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:26,034
I pushed away friends
for my own gain...

394
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,212
But I would do it all again
in a heartbeat.

395
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,997
I will not stop

396
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,695
just because someone
is threatening me.

397
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,527
Your next appearance
is downtown

398
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,485
at the Obsidian store pop-up.

399
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,184
I will have to do a sweep
of the area, twice,

400
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:47,229
and I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

401
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,712
Thank you, Supergirl.

402
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,328
Hi, Steve.

403
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:02,070
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
for whatever I did.

404
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:04,072
Everything okay?

405
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:08,946
No, it's not.

406
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,559
I'm not okay!

407
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,742
Steve! Steve!

408
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,744
Get a medic!

409
00:20:25,746 --> 00:20:27,095
Steve?

410
00:20:28,923 --> 00:20:29,793
Can you hear me?

411
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,535
You had a reaction.

412
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,885
It caused
a grand mal seizure.

413
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,583
Do you remember what happened?

414
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,588
It was Toby.

415
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:45,287
I thought
he was going to hit me.

416
00:20:46,941 --> 00:20:50,074
When he asked me
if I was okay...

417
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,729
I felt something

418
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,949
I'd never felt before.

419
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:56,951
For...

420
00:20:57,778 --> 00:21:00,955
For the first time... ever,

421
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:05,742
I wanted to be the bully.

422
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,615
Fear is the only emotion
I've known for most of my life,

423
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:14,142
but then you came along
and I... finally felt hope.

424
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,278
But now, all I feel is

425
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:24,152
a hunger for revenge,

426
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:27,808
for violence...

427
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,290
It's trapped inside me,

428
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,815
it's trying to
claw its way out,
I can't get rid of it.

429
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:38,297
It's so much worse
than anything that Toby
ever did to me.

430
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,820
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

431
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,605
You fixed those monsters,

432
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:45,478
but what about me?
Why didn't you fix me?

433
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:48,307
I will fix it, okay?
I promise. I promise!

434
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:55,792
You know, I could have
phased us both through.

435
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,838
Yeah, but I really missed
kicking doors in.

436
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:03,452
Whoever this belongs to
has himself a green thumb.

437
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:04,975
Just like a Chlorophyllian.

438
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:08,196
Walden Pond... an idealized
return to nature.

439
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,809
Certainly jives
with the manifesto.

440
00:22:12,853 --> 00:22:15,334
"Our inventions are wont
to be pretty toys,

441
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:18,162
which distract our attention
from serious things."

442
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,642
Look at these schematics.

443
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,470
Looks like he has
a pretty toy all of his own.

444
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:24,168
These are weapons-grade
components.

445
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:26,997
This is what
he must've been trying
to buy on the black market.

446
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,825
Some kind of gauntlet.

447
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,827
I want you by my side
at all times. Got it?

448
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:32,046
You're the boss.

449
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,661
Hello, everyone!

450
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:42,012
Which of you is ready
to change your life?

451
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,544
You shouldn't be here.

452
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:53,720
Watch out!

453
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,096
Hey...

454
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:26,753
Supergirl.

455
00:23:27,449 --> 00:23:28,929
We need to go, now.

456
00:23:33,586 --> 00:23:36,806
What? Wait,
you can't leave me here!

457
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,469
Are you okay?

458
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:50,254
I think so.
-What happened?

459
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,431
Whoever it was,
they were able to take
my powers

460
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:53,736
and use them against me.

461
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:55,477
Is that something
Chlorophyllians can even do?

462
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,566
Not at all.
Must be those gauntlets.

463
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,438
They're enhancing
their abilities,

464
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,440
allowing them to harness
any form of energy,

465
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:03,311
including the powers
of other aliens.

466
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,445
Well, Andrea is safe
at the DEO.

467
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:07,924
Let's see if we can
salvage something.

468
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:08,795
Right.

469
00:24:17,325 --> 00:24:18,761
I'd say
go easy on that thing,

470
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:22,286
but if it takes
the pressure off,
you may as well.

471
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,115
Do you remember when
you turned the sun red,

472
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:26,377
what you told me?

473
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,338
You told me
that you were doing it

474
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:32,601
for the good
of the human race.

475
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:34,951
You deluded yourself
into thinking
you were saving us,

476
00:24:34,995 --> 00:24:36,170
when you were really
killing us.

477
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:39,478
And maybe I'm just
as deluded as you are.

478
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,611
I haven't been deluded
a day in my life.

479
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:44,178
You want to know
what I remember?

480
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:47,137
You showed up at my office
with the Man of Tomorrow award.

481
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:49,357
It was the last time
you were ever proud of me.

482
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,620
We had just made
first contact with
an alien race

483
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,970
and you didn't care.

484
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,972
You didn't see the threat.

485
00:24:56,016 --> 00:25:00,150
You just wanted to focus
on the more philanthropic
efforts of Luthor Corp.

486
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:02,544
And I fired you for it.

487
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:03,980
Why are you telling me this?

488
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,809
Because you're going down
the same path I did,

489
00:25:06,853 --> 00:25:08,724
and you are better than that.

490
00:25:09,856 --> 00:25:11,640
Superman was my downfall.

491
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:14,643
I let my obsession
with destroying him
drive me off-course,

492
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:16,993
but now I have
a second chance

493
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:19,735
to do things the right way,
with you.

494
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:24,174
Non Nocere was supposed
to liberate people,

495
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:26,655
not take away their free will.

496
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:28,004
But all I've managed to do

497
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:29,528
is to trap people
in their own bodies

498
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:32,661
with their ugliest
inclinations.

499
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:35,708
Maybe I have gone down
a dark path.

500
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:39,886
Don't let your obsession
with what Supergirl thinks
get in your way.

501
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,192
You can't change
what's in her heart any more

502
00:25:42,236 --> 00:25:43,716
than you can change mine.

503
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,848
But unlike her,

504
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:47,720
I believe in
what you're doing.

505
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,680
We'll figure this out
together,

506
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:54,291
and I'm not leaving
until we do.

507
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,905
Pull up the algorithm.

508
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,265
You wanna talk?

509
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,096
We almost died today
because I couldn't save us.

510
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:18,707
I don't have freeze breath

511
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,275
and I can't
phase through things.

512
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,930
But it didn't even
matter before then

513
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:27,237
because I had this
entire team that was behind me.

514
00:26:27,281 --> 00:26:29,065
I turned in my gun
and my badge

515
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,764
so that I could stop Lex
from the outside.

516
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,115
I thought the DEO
was holding me back,

517
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,900
but what if it was
holding me up?

518
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:40,163
Alex, when I left the DEO,

519
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,426
I was lost, too.

520
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,299
But you came to me
at a real low point

521
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:48,084
and you reminded me that
sometimes it takes a while

522
00:26:48,128 --> 00:26:50,304
to grow into
the new version of yourself.

523
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,350
It's a process, Alex.

524
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:56,092
And today is the first day.

525
00:26:56,136 --> 00:26:58,617
Give yourself time
to recalibrate.

526
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:02,446
And in the meantime,
just know that we all
have your back.

527
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,665
I found something.

528
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,975
What'd you get?

529
00:27:10,193 --> 00:27:13,936
"Todd Sapphire."
He worked for Obsidian?

530
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,765
Looks like Sapphire had
someone he cared deeply about.

531
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,332
What happened
to him?

532
00:27:20,987 --> 00:27:23,816
According to Obsidian HR,

533
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,296
he became addicted
to the virtual reality lenses

534
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,126
and was terminated
because he stole a pair
for an all-night binge.

535
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,782
Could the attack
on Andrea be retaliation
for getting fired?

536
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,479
This is a suicide note.

537
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,960
Addressed to "My darling Amy.

538
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:40,180
I'm sorry I could not be
stronger for you, my love,

539
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,662
but ever since we left
our home world
I have felt lost

540
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:46,142
and the only relief
I've found is in VR.

541
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:50,059
I'm so homesick
I can't think of anything else.
I can't go on."

542
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:54,977
Wait a minute.

543
00:27:55,021 --> 00:27:56,370
He died a year ago.

544
00:27:58,372 --> 00:28:00,853
So if he's dead,
then he couldn't have
attacked Andrea...

545
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:05,988
Then was it his wife?

546
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,338
She blames
Obsidian for his death.

547
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,994
And the manifesto warned
against making VR
a new paradise...

548
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:13,387
Amy is trying
to stop the launch

549
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,519
to save people
from her husband's fate.

550
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,521
The launch
is in 27 minutes.

551
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,175
I have to get
to CatCo.

552
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:21,047
Get out if you wanna live!

553
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:30,404
You!

554
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,407
Where is Andrea Rojas?

555
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,017
She's not here.

556
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:36,366
Leave these people alone.

557
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,890
I'm stopping the launch.

558
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:44,723
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

559
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,073
This ends now.

560
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:52,905
I'm sorry.
I can't let you stop me.

561
00:29:05,613 --> 00:29:07,746
It's time to put
your toys to bed.

562
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:15,405
-Are you okay?
- I will be.

563
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:17,233
Get everyone out of here.

564
00:29:17,277 --> 00:29:18,626
I'll go after Amy.

565
00:29:21,107 --> 00:29:23,109
Director Dox,
we're receiving reports

566
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,806
of a terrorist event
at Obsidian.

567
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,242
And a massive power outage

568
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,070
that seems to be
spreading across the city.

569
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:31,465
The launch,
the whole Platinum cloud,
has a failsafe.

570
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:33,249
If power is drained
from our generators,

571
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:36,078
the failsafe pulls power
from the city's grid
to ensure the launch.

572
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:38,080
The Luthor PowerCore?

573
00:29:38,124 --> 00:29:40,909
That system reacquires energy
as rapidly as it is lost.

574
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,259
If power continues
to deplete at this rate--

575
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,479
It could not only cause
a massive blackout
to National City,

576
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:48,264
but could also cause
the majority of
its transformers to explode.

577
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,657
Fire, chaos...

578
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,098
I have to get to CatCo
and take the failsafe offline.

579
00:29:56,142 --> 00:29:58,797
No. It's too dangerous.
I'll go.

580
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,625
Please,
take me with you.

581
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,846
Supergirl promised
Mr. Luthor that you would
stay out of danger.

582
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:06,674
Put her in a holding cell.

583
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:12,985
Come on. Come on.

584
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:17,337
Go! Go!

585
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,208
Please stop!

586
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:21,123
If you destroy
the processor
it will explode.

587
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,646
I don't intend to destroy it.

588
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,996
I just need it to stop.

589
00:30:29,175 --> 00:30:30,350
Hi.

590
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,178
Hi.

591
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,229
Follow me,
I'll get you all to safety.

592
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,844
Now, quickly.
Let's go! Let's go!

593
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,737
Amy, no!

594
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,709
No, no, no, no.
This can't be right!

595
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:26,928
Let me go!

596
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,756
Please. I need
to get to CatCo.

597
00:31:47,253 --> 00:31:49,559
Amy, please, you can't
go through with this.

598
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,039
You don't have
any power to stop me.

599
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:53,041
You're right. I'm powerless.

600
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,217
So blast me again
if you want to.

601
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,741
But I know about Todd.

602
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,569
I know how much
you loved each other.

603
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:03,573
And I know
what dark spiral
he went down

604
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,054
after he got addicted
to Obsidian's VR.

605
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:10,058
But Amy, just as Todd
became obsessed
with a virtual world,

606
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:14,410
you have become obsessed
with finding justice for him.

607
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:16,935
No one else should suffer
the way I did.

608
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,939
Oh, my God.

609
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,070
You shouldn't be here.

610
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,593
Who released you
from custody?

611
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:24,812
It's not working.

612
00:32:24,855 --> 00:32:26,945
Someone built a failsafe
into the failsafe

613
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:27,989
to secure the launch.

614
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:30,252
I read your manifesto...

615
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:34,082
Your point that people
would rather live in
a virtual world

616
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,606
than actually help
the real world,

617
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,130
I hear that.

618
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:39,522
I hear you.

619
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,308
It's built to trap you.

620
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,788
An addiction.
That's what it did to Todd.

621
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,616
I know.

622
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,271
But if you go through
with what you're doing,

623
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,621
it won't just shut down
the launch.

624
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:54,624
Innocent people will die.

625
00:32:54,668 --> 00:32:56,452
I know you don't want that.

626
00:32:56,496 --> 00:32:59,281
What you want
is for people to engage.

627
00:32:59,325 --> 00:33:02,806
For people to know
what it's like to be
in the outside world.

628
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,506
To be a partner, to love,
to have friends.

629
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:10,118
Nothing can change the past.

630
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,902
Believe me, I've tried.

631
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,299
But you are in control
of your own future.

632
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:19,867
Todd may not be here anymore,
but you are.

633
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,304
Just look deep
inside yourself and think,

634
00:33:22,348 --> 00:33:25,699
is thiswhat Todd
would have really wanted?

635
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,380
I miss him every day.

636
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:07,175
How did you get back here
so fast from the DEO?

637
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:09,221
I convinced some agents
to bring me.

638
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:15,531
Todd Sapphire became
addicted to a proto version
of Obsidian VR.

639
00:34:15,575 --> 00:34:18,360
Maybe you should
slow down the rollout.

640
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,710
Todd's story was tragic,

641
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:23,365
but he's not
the only story out there.

642
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,541
After the attack tonight,
do you know what happened?

643
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:30,068
Our employees used our VR
to cope with the trauma
they'd just experienced.

644
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:34,202
Bottom line, Supergirl,

645
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:36,596
I'm here to help people.

646
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,120
Remember that.

647
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:50,610
Acrata...
power through shadows.

648
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,627
Well, Alex, you made it
through your first day.

649
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,152
Still no leads
on Lex though.

650
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:14,460
This is gonna be
a long road, Alex.

651
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:18,594
-And I think...

652
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:22,120
...you are gonna need...
some backup.

653
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,776
My gun.

654
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,778
Not quite.

655
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:33,827
Back on Mars we called this...

656
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,656
...or "hand of the soldier."

657
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:39,963
It can transform
into any weapon.

658
00:35:40,007 --> 00:35:41,269
-What?
-You just have to picture it

659
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:42,531
in your mind's eye.

660
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:56,154
Look, I know
you don't have a badge,

661
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,025
but today you proved
you didn't need one.

662
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:00,854
J'onn, this is amazing.

663
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:03,161
-I don't know what to say.

664
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:04,162
Thank you.

665
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,165
With a little practice

666
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,689
you'll learn to control it.

667
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:11,212
Yeah.

668
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,877
It's gone.

669
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:29,404
All that pain...

670
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:31,537
The hunger.

671
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,582
Those feelings, it's as if...

672
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,890
I never had them.

673
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:41,329
How did you do that?

674
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:44,027
My brother, of all people,

675
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:46,508
helped me focus on
what really mattered.

676
00:36:46,552 --> 00:36:48,858
I had accounted
for violent tendencies,

677
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:50,512
but not the feelings
of injustice

678
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,384
which activate
a different part of the brain.

679
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:55,517
So it was just a matter
of tweaking the algorithm
to account for that.

680
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:58,128
Well, whatever you did,
it worked.

681
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:02,742
For the first time in maybe...

682
00:37:03,917 --> 00:37:04,918
ever...

683
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,228
I feel safe.

684
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:13,231
You really are the hero
people say you are.

685
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,407
If this works, the world
won't need heroes.

686
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,110
-That's so cool.
So, it's Martian?
-Yeah.

687
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:25,721
Well, I mean,
it's really a gun though.

688
00:37:25,765 --> 00:37:28,071
Or I mean, whatever weapon
I want it to be.

689
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,899
J'onn just has to train me
how to use it.

690
00:37:29,943 --> 00:37:33,076
Well, even without it today
you were pretty badass.

691
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,557
Who says you need
a badge and the DEO?

692
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,124
-That's right.

693
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,257
Oh! William.

694
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,389
"I couldn't find you
after the attack.
Are you okay?"

695
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,391
That is none of your business.

696
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,394
I really need to text him back.

697
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:49,745
I mean, it sounds like
he still really likes you.

698
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:51,399
Are you regretting
saying no?

699
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,401
I don't know.

700
00:37:53,445 --> 00:37:56,926
I've been so preoccupied
with people using VR
to escape the real world,

701
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,581
when that's exactly
what I'm doing with William.

702
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm avoiding my own reality.

703
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:04,282
Well, it sounds like
you know what
you need to do.

704
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,286
It's just one dinner, right?

705
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,288
Yeah.

706
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:18,774
I'm alive.

707
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:21,603
Kara! Oh, thank God.

708
00:38:21,647 --> 00:38:24,432
I heard you got out
but it's much better to...

709
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,434
-...see for myself.

710
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,131
Yeah. By the time I had
gotten your messages,

711
00:38:28,175 --> 00:38:29,959
I figured
it was easier to just

712
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,352
show you proof of life.

713
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:32,484
Yeah, sure.

714
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,443
So how did you know
I was here?

715
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,489
Well, it's common knowledge
you're a night owl

716
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:38,881
and a workaholic,

717
00:38:38,925 --> 00:38:41,797
and one of the most
dedicated reporters I know.

718
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:45,018
I think you give me
a run for my money there.

719
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:49,327
Oh, God, this is too much,
isn't it?

720
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:52,634
The coffee, the texts,
the compliments.

721
00:38:52,678 --> 00:38:54,332
I'm sorry, you asked
to be friends

722
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,637
and I should be
respecting that,

723
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:57,160
but instead I've been
overstepping all day.

724
00:38:57,204 --> 00:38:58,814
No, no, no. Not at all.

725
00:38:58,858 --> 00:38:59,989
It's fine.

726
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:01,861
That's actually why
I'm here.

727
00:39:03,036 --> 00:39:05,473
I made a mistake last week

728
00:39:05,517 --> 00:39:07,519
because I was scared.

729
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,999
You're a great guy.

730
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:11,479
More than a great guy.

731
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:14,352
And... And I would
love to go out.

732
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,225
I would love that.

733
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,495
There's my favorite Coluan.

734
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,018
The progress you've made
inverting the code,

735
00:39:29,062 --> 00:39:30,716
-looks like a real killer.

736
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:32,718
Don't you just love it
when a plan comes together?

737
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,202
What? You don't love it?

738
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,857
I encountered
your Luthor PowerCore
this evening

739
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,382
and was unable
to take it offline.

740
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:48,516
I texted you for assistance
and I got no reply.

741
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,868
That failsafe
endangered 67%
of National City's population.

742
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:54,870
So a few houses
could've burned down.

743
00:39:54,914 --> 00:39:56,045
Small price for progress.

744
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,047
People could have died.

745
00:39:58,091 --> 00:39:59,397
If Supergirl hadn't--

746
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,572
But she did.

747
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,402
Have you forgotten,
Director Dox?

748
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:07,056
Supergirl always
saves the day.

749
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,712
Saving Obsidian Platinum
solidified our worth
to our new friends.

750
00:40:13,149 --> 00:40:15,413
Gotta go. Time to close.

751
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:24,247
Forgive me for
keeping you waiting.

752
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,075
You should be more considerate.

753
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:29,252
When you make promises,
those around you
expect you to keep them.

754
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:32,255
I know that
to the untrained eye,

755
00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:34,432
-today did not seem ideal.
-Oh.

756
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,564
Fires, police, superheroes.

757
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:40,916
Which part of this
do you consider not ideal?

758
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,615
I believe that a woman with
your wisdom and foresight

759
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:46,966
would see that we delivered
the results you desired,

760
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:48,968
we just did it with panache.

761
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:52,101
And without you having
to stick out your pretty neck.

762
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:55,278
But I believe fate
has thrown us together.

763
00:40:55,322 --> 00:40:59,979
Me, the most trusted
and beloved man on Earth...

764
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,111
Who better to represent
Obsidian Platinum

765
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:05,027
in its worldwide rollout
than Lex Luthor?

766
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:09,118
I'm the chocolate
to your peanut butter.

767
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,598
With me as
your global ambassador,

768
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:13,775
there won't be an eyeball
from Tokyo to Tajikistan

769
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:15,342
without Obsidian lenses
on it.

770
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:19,477
You make
a persuasive case, Lex.

771
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,826
Hmm, as I told you,

772
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:22,784
I can be an excellent
friend when I want to be.

773
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,830
And I want to be
very good friends.

774
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:27,354
So tell me this...

775
00:41:28,181 --> 00:41:29,965
As a friend,

776
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:33,012
do you expect something
in return?

777
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,884
It would be lovely
to meet your friends.

778
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:40,672
Make good on your word,

779
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,196
and we can discuss.
