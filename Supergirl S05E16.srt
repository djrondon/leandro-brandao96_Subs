1
00:00:01,305 --> 00:00:03,220
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:06,267
People use our VR
to cope with trauma
they experience.

3
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,965
Your failsafe failed.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,141
I assure you,
this glitch will be fixed.

5
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,057
You just rest easy, Mr. Bates.

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:15,928
I've got you now.

7
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:16,973
They found Dad.

8
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:18,757
He's dead.

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,327
I still can't believe it.

10
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,027
Of all the places for Jeremiah
to hide out,

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,550
the Peruvian Andes.

12
00:00:28,593 --> 00:00:31,248
Yeah. It's where he found you.

13
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,294
Clearly, that place
meant a lot to him.

14
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:34,773
He was doing humanitarian work?

15
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:37,080
In a refugee camp.

16
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,126
Helping displaced aliens.

17
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,954
After everything
that Jeremiah endured,

18
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:43,739
it's hard to believe
he died of a cardiac arrest.

19
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:46,133
It's surreal.

20
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,310
Hey, how are you,
uh, how're you doing?

21
00:00:49,353 --> 00:00:50,572
I'm sad.

22
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:54,315
It's painful to know
he's really gone.

23
00:00:54,358 --> 00:00:57,100
But you know what?
I'm also relieved to know

24
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,754
he was a good man that...

25
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,452
That brought me some peace.

26
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,454
That's one thing
I never doubted...

27
00:01:03,498 --> 00:01:05,326
is that Jeremiah
loved his daughters.

28
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,504
That's what Eliza
said to me this morning.

29
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,988
Kara.
I'm so sorry.

30
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,556
Thanks, Kelly.
I'm so glad Alex has you.

31
00:01:19,949 --> 00:01:21,342
So where is she?
Are you guys ready?

32
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,473
I'm not going.

33
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:23,909
Uh...

34
00:01:23,953 --> 00:01:25,737
And you can spare me
the big accusing eyes, Kara,

35
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:26,912
I'm not changing my mind.

36
00:01:26,956 --> 00:01:27,957
Excuse me.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,003
Um... Alex,
I don't understand.

38
00:01:31,047 --> 00:01:33,484
You were with me last night
when we made the arrangements.

39
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,095
I never said
that I was participating.

40
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,185
I... I know you're in pain.

41
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:40,143
-I'm not in pain.
-Of course you are.

42
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:42,189
Okay, stop telling me
how I feel.

43
00:01:42,232 --> 00:01:44,800
Okay, then you tell me
how you feel.

44
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:48,369
Tell me why you're refusing
to go to your father's funeral.

45
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:50,980
Because I don't feel the need
to bury a man

46
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:52,808
who has been
dead to me for years.

47
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,592
Jeremiah
was changing his ways.

48
00:01:54,636 --> 00:01:56,333
He was helping people,
making amends.

49
00:01:56,377 --> 00:01:57,552
Well, not to me.

50
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,945
He had to live in secrecy
for his safety.

51
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,077
Right.

52
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,687
After leaving Cadmus,
did you think

53
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:04,211
he was just gonna be able to
call us whenever he felt like?

54
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:06,387
I am the one
who held out hope for him.

55
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,997
I am the one that said
that he was good,

56
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,217
and that Cadmus was forcing him
to kill people.

57
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,740
And he helped you escape.

58
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,046
And then he disappeared. Again.

59
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,178
Just like that!

60
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:16,353
Alex, he's still your father.

61
00:02:17,267 --> 00:02:18,964
You should be at his burial.

62
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,183
Look, the man that I loved

63
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:23,273
hasn't been a father
to me in years.

64
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,536
And... and, yes.

65
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,191
Yes, we were so close

66
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:31,368
that we could just...
we could finish
each other's sentences.

67
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,025
But his obsession
with keeping you safe

68
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:37,461
changed all of it.

69
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,855
Nothing else mattered to him,
the least of all me.

70
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:41,291
That is not true.

71
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,640
Come on, Kara.

72
00:02:42,684 --> 00:02:45,077
He treated you like
you were some golden girl,

73
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:49,821
and of course
you have love for him,
and I totally respect that.

74
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:54,348
But he treated me like
I wasn't even worth his time.

75
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,657
Okay.

76
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,485
So, what do you
want me to tell Eliza?

77
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:05,620
-I don't care.
-You don't care.

78
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,665
You don't care what I tell
our grieving mother?

79
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,147
I have spent my entire life
protecting this whole family,

80
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,453
and I will not do it again.

81
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,676
She is all yours, Kelly.
I'm not dealing with this.

82
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:22,245
People
grieve differently,

83
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:24,682
and Alex is reeling.

84
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:27,381
Okay, you guys go to Midvale,
I'll talk to her.

85
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:29,296
-There's still time.
-Call me if you need any help.

86
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,384
Okay, thank you.

87
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:46,095
-It's a bit early for that.
-Don't.

88
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,097
Look, I get it.

89
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,838
You know I have had
a lot of loss.

90
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:51,143
I know how you feel.

91
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:53,233
You have no idea...

92
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,452
how I feel.

93
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:59,543
I have mourned
the loss of my father

94
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:01,763
multiple times.

95
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:09,205
You have no idea
this stabbing pain here.

96
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:16,343
I'm losing him over and over
and over again.

97
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,955
And I really...

98
00:04:19,998 --> 00:04:23,741
I really can't tolerate
being psychoanalyzed

99
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,178
by my girlfriend right now.

100
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,355
-I'm sorry.
-So rather than your apology,

101
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:31,314
what I want
is to be left alone.

102
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:32,141
Okay.

103
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,492
I will give you space.

104
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,321
But just know
that I love you

105
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:41,106
and I'm here
for you unconditionally.

106
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,544
-And when you're ready,
just call.

107
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:45,981
You got it.

108
00:04:57,035 --> 00:04:59,473
But now
we want you to know
you're in good hands.

109
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,739
Hope, help
and compassion for all.

110
00:05:04,782 --> 00:05:05,957
- Call us--

111
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,114
Let's go punch things.

112
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:38,093
Hey, Kelly.

113
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:39,486
Will.

114
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,488
I heard about Kara
and Alex's dad.

115
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:43,446
I'm sorry for all of you.

116
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,317
Thanks.

117
00:06:45,361 --> 00:06:46,318
Hey, shouldn't you guys be
getting on the road

118
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,319
for the funeral about now?

119
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:48,712
Yeah, we should.

120
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:51,323
But things are complicated
with her and her dad.

121
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:54,588
So she says she doesn't
wanna go to Midvale today.

122
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,459
-That's rough.
-Yeah, but there's still time.

123
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,026
So I am giving her space

124
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:00,507
and hoping
she changes her mind.

125
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,466
Which leaves me here
with nothing to do but worry.

126
00:07:05,076 --> 00:07:08,515
Well, if you are looking
to pass the time,

127
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,994
-I could use a favor.
-Yeah.

128
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:14,608
In the past three weeks,

129
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,654
Lex Luthor has rushed
32 satellites

130
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,483
through approval by the FAA
and launched them into space.

131
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:22,659
Each of their orbits
placed them directly
above a city

132
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,923
that Lex himself is visiting
on this Obsidian world tour.

133
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,536
So you're wondering
what the satellites have to do

134
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:31,842
-with the Obsidian
Platinum's launch.
-Mmm.

135
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:34,366
Nothing, as far as I'm aware.

136
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,543
Platinum operates off
of booster towers.

137
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:39,502
So, whatever Lex's business
is with the satellites,

138
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,722
it has nothing to do
with us.

139
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,375
But you're still
skeptical of him?

140
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,117
Yeah, I worry about what
Lex is doing with our platform.

141
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,076
And Alex is skeptical, too.

142
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:50,557
So I'm keeping an eye
out for anything

143
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,517
that might prove that
Lex isn't the hero
that everyone thinks.

144
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,738
Still, you don't think
he's doing anything wrong here?

145
00:07:57,781 --> 00:07:58,869
Not that I can tell.

146
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,523
Since Luthor Corp came aboard

147
00:08:00,567 --> 00:08:02,525
the only glitch
involved a failsafe.

148
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,353
And that was a fluke.

149
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:08,531
A lone hacker, Richard Bates,
exploited it for his own ends.

150
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,665
You don't think there's
any chance this Richard
was working with Lex?

151
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:15,669
What would Alex say?

152
00:08:16,757 --> 00:08:21,413
That with Lex,
anything is possible.

153
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:38,822
Man, this guy's really great.

154
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:41,825
Hey, Supergirl,

155
00:08:41,869 --> 00:08:43,523
I haven't seen you
in VR before.

156
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:45,742
Treasure Hunter Tilly.

157
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,004
I'm a participant like you.

158
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,137
Oh. Oh, cool.

159
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,574
Most of these people are bots.

160
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,621
The simulation maps your brain,

161
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:55,926
so it'll populate your world

162
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,580
with things that feel
familiar to you.

163
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,974
People you know,
places you've been.

164
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:03,368
Well, they do look
very, very real.

165
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,806
All you gotta do
is check the neck.

166
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,155
If you see three stripes,

167
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:09,810
that means they're
a non-player character.

168
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,595
The ones without stripes,
we're the realies.

169
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,206
Right. Well, thank you, Tilly.

170
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,686
Call me Bonnie.

171
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:19,384
Alex.

172
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,996
My sister Jill is Supergirl's
biggest fan in real life.

173
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,650
Oh, that's great.

174
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:28,089
So are you blowing off
steam playing hero,

175
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:30,265
or working something out?

176
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:34,661
You know, I'm just taking
a break from the real world.

177
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:38,012
Yeah,
the real world sucks.

178
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,535
Yeah.

179
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:43,670
Jill was just diagnosed
with stage four cancer

180
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,194
and I can't even afford
the flight to go see her.

181
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,370
I'm so sorry. That's terrible.

182
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:50,154
It is.

183
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,550
But in here,
it's all good, right?

184
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,509
Even if it's just
for a few hours.

185
00:09:57,553 --> 00:09:59,686
So, who's this rock starman?

186
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,427
His real name
is Derek something

187
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:04,473
and he's in here all the time.

188
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,519
Word is his wife passed away.

189
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:10,653
If you ask me, he stays in VR
way longer than is healthy.

190
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:14,701
And that's my ride.

191
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,095
See you around, Supergirl.

192
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,897
That was metal!

193
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,072
Thanks, Supergirl.

194
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:39,682
Sure.

195
00:10:39,726 --> 00:10:41,162
It's amazing how real
all this feels.

196
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:44,208
All this...

197
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,515
Virtual reality.

198
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:53,348
Virtual reality.

199
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:57,918
What's she
talking about?

200
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:59,615
One, two, three, four!

201
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,770
Okay. Dragon at the fountain.

202
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:25,772
What would Kara do?

203
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,122
Heat vision.

204
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:29,732
Okay.

205
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:34,345
Kara makes this look so easy.

206
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,825
All right.

207
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:46,140
Okay.

208
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,338
Supergirl, how does it feel
to defeat a Dracokardosian?

209
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,253
Uh, I'm just glad
that I could help.

210
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:13,645
So what are you
going to do now?

211
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,038
Well, does anyone know

212
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:16,083
where a girl can get a bite
to eat around here?

213
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,088
That settles it.

214
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:23,003
Uh, there's nothing
that connects Lex
to the failsafe hack

215
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,700
or to the guy that did it.

216
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,833
But if that guy was able to
hack that part of your system,

217
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,704
who's to say
Lex won't target it, too?

218
00:12:31,228 --> 00:12:32,969
What is it?
Did Lex do something?

219
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,492
No, not something he did,

220
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,930
something we should
have done and didn't.

221
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:40,803
The failsafe error I found,
it wasn't patched after all.

222
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:41,804
You mean the back door's
still open?

223
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,240
Yeah.

224
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,807
But that means that

225
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,026
there's a chance other people
could still be in there.

226
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,070
I need to find Andrea.

227
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,290
Kelly, what's going on?

228
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,988
The failsafe glitch
Richard Bates exploited,

229
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,468
it hasn't been fixed.

230
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:54,904
-What?
-Yeah,

231
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,427
I thought maybe it was
a slip-up with the records,

232
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:57,559
but I checked.

233
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,821
The order for the patch
was put in,

234
00:12:58,865 --> 00:13:01,084
but the work funds
haven't been released.

235
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:06,786
Look...

236
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:10,006
we have to do something
about this right now.

237
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,486
Kelly, I understand
your concern,

238
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,444
but what happened last week
was because of the hacker,

239
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,707
not a flaw in our system.

240
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:17,231
And since then,
there have been no reports

241
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:18,667
of anyone being affected,
have there?

242
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:21,713
No.

243
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:24,020
This withholding
of funds is just

244
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,717
corporate bureaucracy
with the board.

245
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:26,980
I'll handle it.

246
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,459
But there's nothing
to alarm our users about.

247
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,898
You don't think our users
deserve a warning

248
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,508
that the lenses
might be problematic?

249
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:35,640
All that would do is make them
worry about the platform,

250
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,729
and then they wouldn't be able
to use the platform

251
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,427
to get over their worries.

252
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,559
And when it comes to veterans
and sufferers of mental trauma,

253
00:13:41,603 --> 00:13:43,605
do we really wanna stop giving
them what they need?

254
00:13:45,781 --> 00:13:47,478
I would never let our consumers

255
00:13:47,522 --> 00:13:50,481
engage in anything that
would put them in jeopardy.

256
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:53,006
Still, I'll call into Gemma
and get the funds released

257
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,137
and that glitch fixed.

258
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:57,706
Okay. Thanks.

259
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:58,968
Thank you.

260
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,671
-Well, if it isn't Supergirl.
-Hmm.

261
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:08,978
Hi.

262
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,288
These blueberry pancakes
are absolutely insane.

263
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,899
I mean, they're just like
from when I was back home.

264
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,119
It's, like,
crispy on the outside

265
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:20,903
and a little bit gooey
on the inside.

266
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,645
Oh, my God.

267
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:28,955
Kelly could come here
and eat these without dying.

268
00:14:28,998 --> 00:14:31,522
Don't tell me, is Kelly
one of your Super Friends?

269
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,307
Uh, no.

270
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,612
No, no, no.
She's my girlfriend.

271
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:38,138
My very smart, and kind,

272
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:41,271
and wonderfully
supportive girlfriend

273
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,360
who I was a complete
jerk to this morning.

274
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,842
-We all have our bad days.
-Hmm.

275
00:14:47,974 --> 00:14:49,323
This is a little bit
more than that.

276
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:55,590
I just found out
that my father passed away.

277
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:59,115
He kind of treated me
like I was an equal.

278
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,857
Especially when it came
to taking care of my mother.

279
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,207
And definitely when it came
to taking care of my sister.

280
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:10,170
And, uh, I don't know,
I thought it was really cool

281
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,520
that he would give me
that kind of responsibility,

282
00:15:12,563 --> 00:15:16,828
but I look back at it now,
and I'm... I just...

283
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:20,093
Like it is totally unfair
that he put all of that on me.

284
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,099
I mean, my sister,
she can be a handful.

285
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,972
So I thought
if I came in here, um,

286
00:15:30,016 --> 00:15:32,192
I could just feel some
freedom for myself.

287
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:35,108
I could fly around
and I could knock things down

288
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,675
without anybody being
able to stop me.

289
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,982
And then I would...
I would feel better.

290
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:42,463
But I don't.

291
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,683
I mean, not really.

292
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,209
'Cause, I mean,
my dad's still dead.

293
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,996
My girlfriend, she's right.

294
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,434
I have a lot of things
to work through.

295
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,439
Anyway, that was... wow.

296
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,441
Um...

297
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,052
I, uh...

298
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,489
I think it's about time that
I go back to the real world.

299
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,447
What do you mean?

300
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:16,062
Uh, just that
this has been a lot of fun,

301
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:19,021
but I think it's time
to get back to reality.

302
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:19,848
"Reality"?

303
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,460
Are you okay, hon?

304
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:26,202
How about another round
for my favorite customers?

305
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,029
Works for me.

306
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:34,602
Have you heard any more
about your sister?

307
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,517
-My sister?
-Jill.

308
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,001
Okay, how long
have you been in here, Bonnie?

309
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:43,872
I'm Tilly.

310
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:47,223
Treasure Hunter Tilly.

311
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:48,311
Supergirl.

312
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,357
J'onn?

313
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,880
We need you
at the DEO right now.

314
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,056
You're in the DEO?

315
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,276
Supergirl, don't worry
about your friend.

316
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,277
She's working through things.

317
00:16:58,278 --> 00:16:59,453
Like you.

318
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,237
I'll see she gets
to where she needs to go.

319
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,804
Keep 'em coming, Mac.

320
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,894
Hey, um...

321
00:17:07,287 --> 00:17:08,244
Good luck with everything.

322
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:10,029
You, too.

323
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,755
Oh, it's just
like the real DEO.

324
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:44,498
Maybe even better
than the real DEO.

325
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,326
-Supergirl.
-Director J'onzz.

326
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,676
We've just had word that
a short-range ballistic missile

327
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:51,244
was stolen from
Thompson Marine Base
by unknown terrorists.

328
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,116
Paired with the right tech,
an SRBM like that

329
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,120
has the capacity
to wipe out everything
within a 20-mile radius.

330
00:17:58,164 --> 00:17:59,687
Can we track it?

331
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,036
We're sweeping
the city for its signature now.

332
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:06,737
This is the part where you say

333
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,522
you'll circle the city
and track these guys down.

334
00:18:08,565 --> 00:18:09,566
Right, yes.

335
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,134
Uh, sorry, I was just...

336
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:14,789
You have no idea how good
it feels to be here with you.

337
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:16,269
Supergirl,

338
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,445
-this is Hank Henshaw.

339
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,794
-There's only one thing alive
on less than four legs

340
00:18:19,837 --> 00:18:21,274
that can hear this frequency.

341
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:22,362
And that's you.

342
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,580
Are you okay?

343
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,278
-It's Henshaw.
- What?

344
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,802
He's speaking to me in some
sort of high-pitched frequency.

345
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:29,760
My God. It is Henshaw.

346
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,980
As I'm sure you've discovered
by now,

347
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:34,374
I've stolen a missile
from a nearby base.

348
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:36,332
What you haven't discovered

349
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:39,248
is that while the DEO
is focused on my larceny,

350
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,163
-I kidnapped your sister.
-Kara?

351
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:45,341
Sprock! It is true. Look.

352
00:18:45,385 --> 00:18:47,343
How?

353
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,389
The only way he could know
Kara is your sister

354
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:52,043
is if he found out
your secret identity.

355
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,219
There's
a nuclear warhead

356
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,437
at the Tamaki Air Force Base

357
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,091
south of the city.

358
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,962
Get it and deliver it
to the abandoned warehouse

359
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,182
on Waterfront Road
within the hour.

360
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,750
Do it, or I'll reveal your
secret identity

361
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,274
-and kill your sister.

362
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:08,799
Alex, I know your history
with Henshaw.

363
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:11,062
Promise me you won't let
feelings cloud your judgment

364
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,238
as we bring him to justice.

365
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:15,110
I can handle it.

366
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,329
Where's Kara?

367
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,374
She's safe.

368
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:20,289
For now.

369
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,334
What do you want?

370
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,206
What do I want?

371
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:27,644
Your father...

372
00:19:27,688 --> 00:19:30,995
infiltrated my organization,
ambushed me.

373
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,606
Left me for dead
in the jungle.

374
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,262
So this is what I want!

375
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,924
You didn't think I'd come
unprepared, did you?

376
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,451
You didn't think I'd bring
an active warhead, did you?

377
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:56,934
I still have the missile.

378
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:59,415
And I still have you.

379
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:02,679
That's enough to get the DEO
back to its former glory.

380
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,160
By blowing it up
and starting over.

381
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,427
And now the DEO, your sister...

382
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,083
and everyone you love will die.

383
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:22,699
No one will be able
to save them... or you.

384
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,440
I don't need anyone to save me.

385
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:27,922
Because I am Supergirl!

386
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:48,638
Supergirl.
-J'onn.

387
00:20:48,682 --> 00:20:50,945
I've got Henshaw,
but I don't know where...

388
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,120
We have Kara.

389
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,383
She's safe.

390
00:20:56,516 --> 00:21:00,084
You should not
have come back.

391
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,956
And now you'll never
hurt my family again.

392
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,182
-Hey.
-Hey.

393
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,622
So...

394
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:18,494
Andrea said the failsafe patch
wasn't addressed

395
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:21,497
because of bureaucracy
with the board.

396
00:21:24,587 --> 00:21:25,980
But...

397
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,982
Ever since Luthor Corp
partnered with us...

398
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,027
...the board
has a new member...

399
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:31,594
Lex.

400
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,770
So maybe he was behind it.

401
00:21:33,814 --> 00:21:35,903
He could have pressured
other board members

402
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:37,078
to ignore the glitch

403
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,688
so he could exploit it
for his own ends.

404
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:41,996
Maybe trap people inside the VR
and lock in subscribers.

405
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,259
Yeah, but we don't have
any facts to back that up.

406
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,916
Well, there has to be
something we can do.

407
00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:51,745
This is a list
of almost 500 users

408
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,965
who have been using our VR
non-stop for 48 hours or more.

409
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:58,142
No one's called
about them, but...

410
00:21:58,186 --> 00:22:00,057
-They could still be trapped.
-Yeah.

411
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:02,799
How do you feel about
helping me

412
00:22:02,843 --> 00:22:03,974
make a few hundred
phone calls?

413
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,587
Hey.

414
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:10,416
Good job today.

415
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,027
-Henshaw's in containment.
-Good.

416
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,638
-How's Kara?
- Back at CatCo,

417
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:17,379
finishing her article
as we speak.

418
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,773
Oh, and she, uh,
wanted me to remind you,

419
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,384
it's your turn to pick up
the dumplings tonight.

420
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:25,431
-That's my sister.

421
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:28,782
I know that look.

422
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,219
Is something on your mind?

423
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,353
Yeah, I just, um...

424
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:39,575
I don't know, everything just
feels so... so good.

425
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,229
Hmm.

426
00:22:41,272 --> 00:22:44,580
But I keep having this feeling
that I've forgotten something.

427
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:47,496
Kind of like the
"Did I lock the front door?"

428
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,063
-kind of feeling.
-Hmm.

429
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,805
But still, I...

430
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,677
I know that I'm doing
what I'm supposed to be doing.

431
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,506
I've got my team,
I've got my family...

432
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,640
Everything, it feels...

433
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:04,295
Right?

434
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,647
Alex, you saved your family,

435
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:10,998
the DEO, and the citizens
of National City today.

436
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:12,608
That feeling you can't
quite pin down...

437
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:14,828
it's called happiness.

438
00:23:16,351 --> 00:23:18,048
Now, come on,
let's go celebrate.

439
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:19,398
Brainy's buying.

440
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:21,443
-You're right.

441
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,749
-Let's celebrate.
-Yeah.

442
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:32,933
♪ Feelings

443
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:40,419
♪ Nothing more than feelings

444
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:47,121
♪ Trying to forget my...

445
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:48,644
Thank you,

446
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:50,951
President Lincoln.

447
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,479
Hey, I'm sorry
about that abomination.

448
00:23:57,523 --> 00:23:59,655
If he'd read a history book,
he'd know

449
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,832
that Honest Abe belongs
in the audience of the theater,

450
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,313
not on the stage.

451
00:24:05,356 --> 00:24:09,273
Do we have a John Wilkes Booth
in the house?

452
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,362
- Come on.
-Boo!

453
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:14,322
What? You don't think
that's funny? Hmm?

454
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:20,937
Now, back to our show.

455
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:22,678
Who's next?

456
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:25,420
Ah, I see a sister Kryptonian.

457
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,378
To Supergirl!

458
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:28,771
Oh, silence.

459
00:24:28,815 --> 00:24:30,686
Sorry, Vita,
I got carried away for a sec.

460
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,948
Well, you're spared,

461
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:34,298
but you're sent
to the back of the line.

462
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:37,476
And no more Britney Spears
songs if you want to live.

463
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:40,566
-I'll go get the drinks.
-Okay.

464
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,742
You happy?

465
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,439
Never happier.

466
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:56,843
Yes, I understand.

467
00:24:57,713 --> 00:24:58,758
Very sorry to bother you.

468
00:24:59,715 --> 00:25:01,238
Yes.

469
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:06,592
Wow, so that's 100
phone calls to 100 users,

470
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,332
none who are trapped.

471
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,770
Maybe I've taken us both
down a conspiracy rabbit hole.

472
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,905
-There any word from Alex yet?
-Uh, I texted,

473
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,603
and, um, no response.

474
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,824
Maybe she still
needs space.

475
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,394
You know,

476
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:28,570
sometimes people
need a shoulder to cry on

477
00:25:28,614 --> 00:25:29,571
even if they won't admit it.

478
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,486
You should go to her.

479
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:33,749
I'll keep on this.

480
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,272
Saw you looking at it,
I'll keep on it.

481
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,232
In fact, I have a contact
at the NSA

482
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:39,886
who might be able to help us
speed things up.

483
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,628
You go be with
the woman you love.

484
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:43,542
Thank you.

485
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,774
Well, well, well, if it isn't
my favorite customer.

486
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:00,297
Want a drink
on the house, Supergirl?

487
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:01,560
Why not?

488
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,391
Well, if it isn't
my favorite customer.

489
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:08,871
Want a round
on the house, Supergirl?

490
00:26:08,915 --> 00:26:09,785
Heck, yeah.

491
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:13,310
Hey.

492
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:15,617
Supergirl.

493
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:19,099
Hi. That's a...
That's a really great costume.

494
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,622
Black.

495
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:23,103
Now that is cool.

496
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,628
Um... Sorry, what are you
talking about?

497
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,805
Oh, I love this place.

498
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:32,112
They just never make the drinks
cold enough, though.

499
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:39,685
That... How did you...

500
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,687
I've come here
to escape reality.

501
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,427
Not have subpar drinks.

502
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,516
This... This isn't real?

503
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,475
What, you think all these
drinks would be on the house?

504
00:26:49,564 --> 00:26:50,521
Are you okay?

505
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:53,524
This is impossible.

506
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,178
You look like
you are bugging out.

507
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:57,746
I'll just get someone.

508
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:03,534
Supergirl. Are you all right?

509
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:05,841
How can there be
two Supergirls?

510
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,887
Perhaps it's the result
from Kryptonite poisoning.

511
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,020
Should we head to the DEO?

512
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,805
Perhaps we should go
back to the medbay.

513
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:15,111
No, this isn't real.

514
00:27:16,722 --> 00:27:17,810
I have to get out of here.

515
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,681
I have to go.

516
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:27,646
That was weird.

517
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,584
Alex. Are you okay?

518
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:55,717
-Alex?
-J'onn?

519
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,980
Psi just launched
a psychic attack
on National City.

520
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:00,287
She's making everybody
doubt their reality.

521
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,115
Don't tell me
she got to you, too.

522
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:03,986
-We need you here.
-No, I'm all right.

523
00:28:07,773 --> 00:28:08,687
And I'm on my way.

524
00:28:17,391 --> 00:28:18,392
Hello?

525
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:21,700
Alex?

526
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:26,748
What's wrong with your lenses?

527
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,490
You wanna come out? Hey.

528
00:28:40,066 --> 00:28:40,849
Okay, babe.

529
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:44,157
It's time to wake up.

530
00:28:56,691 --> 00:28:57,779
Don't worry.

531
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:00,173
I'm coming in
to get you.

532
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,790
Well, I guess some villains
are all thought and no action.

533
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,838
-Alex.
-Kelly.

534
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,970
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

535
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:16,406
I just... I didn't know
if you had tried to get out,

536
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,017
but your failsafe
isn't working.

537
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:19,627
What?

538
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,846
The glitch that
Richard Bates hacked,

539
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:22,891
it wasn't fixed.

540
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:26,025
Um, and I think you might
have been affected.

541
00:29:26,068 --> 00:29:28,462
I can't eject you, so I need
you to wake yourself up

542
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:29,593
and end your simulation,

543
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,291
and then I'll tell
you everything.

544
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,162
End... end my simulation? I...

545
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:35,861
You need to exit
your virtual reality.

546
00:29:35,904 --> 00:29:38,689
I can't do it for you.
You have to do it for yourself.

547
00:29:41,431 --> 00:29:42,432
Oh, my God.

548
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:45,566
Psi must have
gotten to her, too.

549
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:47,873
What? No.

550
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,222
I'll make sure
she gets to the medbay.

551
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:50,876
I don't need to go
to the medbay.

552
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,487
You have to end this.
This isn't real. You know that.

553
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,837
A-ha! She was
assaulted by Psi.

554
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,012
That never happened.

555
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,231
Hey, Alex,

556
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,841
can't you see
that this virtual reality

557
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:01,190
is just giving you
what you want?

558
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,670
Supergirl.

559
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,324
There's a theft in progress
at National City Bank.

560
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,456
NCPD is on their way,
but they won't make it in time.

561
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,981
Kelly, I have to handle this.

562
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:10,852
You go with J'onn and Brainy
to the medbay.

563
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,071
They'll take care of you,
I promise.

564
00:30:13,115 --> 00:30:13,899
Let's go.

565
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:19,339
End simulation.

566
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,776
Okay, slow down, Kelly.

567
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,083
Are you sure that this is
a failsafe malfunction?

568
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:26,346
I don't know.
That is why I called you.

569
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:29,044
Alex's lenses
are practically red.

570
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:32,352
And she's not responding to
any of my methods of ejection.

571
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,570
I tried adrenaline,

572
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:35,442
but it was like
she didn't even feel it.

573
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:37,357
What about going into the VR
for direct contact?

574
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,706
Yeah,
I tried that, too,

575
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:40,926
and there was no sign
of a failsafe button.

576
00:30:42,144 --> 00:30:44,538
She wouldn't even listen to me.

577
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:47,802
Before she went in,
she was grieving.

578
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,760
I don't know, maybe because
of her emotional state,

579
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,675
she was more
susceptible to our AI

580
00:30:51,719 --> 00:30:54,069
and had a mild psychotic break.

581
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,897
I've seen this
with some of my patients,

582
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:57,029
but still...

583
00:30:57,072 --> 00:30:58,813
I'm still able
to bring them out.

584
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,902
Okay, Kelly, look.
We need to think this through.

585
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,340
It was like
she was lost in there.

586
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:09,476
Then we need a way
to shock her out.

587
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,131
We need to show Alex that
she is not in the real world

588
00:31:12,174 --> 00:31:14,960
by confronting her with
something that's unexplainable,

589
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:17,397
but also absolutely undeniable.

590
00:31:22,532 --> 00:31:24,099
Something like Alex herself.

591
00:31:33,369 --> 00:31:35,023
I hope this works.

592
00:31:41,464 --> 00:31:43,336
Thanks, Supergirl.

593
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,120
These guys sure chose
the wrong bank to rob.

594
00:31:46,817 --> 00:31:47,949
Speaking of bad choices,

595
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,124
there's still time enough
for you

596
00:31:49,168 --> 00:31:50,430
to turn your life around,
young lady.

597
00:31:52,562 --> 00:31:53,389
Hi, Alex.

598
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:56,958
How do you know my real name?

599
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:57,916
Because I'm you.

600
00:31:59,004 --> 00:31:59,830
You can feel it.

601
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,008
How?

602
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,618
I've been sent to show you
something that you need to see.

603
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,147
Please.

604
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,627
Please listen to her.

605
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,195
-What do I need to see?
-That none of this is real.

606
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,153
Yes, it is. Of course it is.

607
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:20,677
Supergirl, is everything okay?

608
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:24,029
Come with me, and I'll show you
the truth you've been avoiding.

609
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:27,162
Come on, Supergirl,
the NCPD can take it from here.

610
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,250
Supergirl, let us help you.

611
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:29,991
Or are you afraid
of facing reality?

612
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:38,826
I remember this place.

613
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:41,220
That...

614
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:44,397
That bomb,
I planted that bomb.

615
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,616
This is the Cadmus facility
where I last saw Dad.

616
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,580
-Is that--
-Jeremiah.

617
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:56,409
We didn't face him before,
but we need to now.

618
00:32:56,452 --> 00:32:59,586
Maybe now he can explain
why he never came back.

619
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,022
- Hey!

620
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:02,415
Supergirl, get away from her!

621
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,677
She's a shape-shifter.

622
00:33:05,244 --> 00:33:07,463
-No.
-Come on. I know another way.

623
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,290
Okay.

624
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:14,470
There he is.

625
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,084
Dad?

626
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,267
This is what
you needed to see.

627
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:31,052
The truth in the real world.

628
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:33,098
The real world?

629
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,839
The real world
where we're not Supergirl.

630
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,363
And where even if we were,

631
00:33:37,406 --> 00:33:40,235
nothing that we could have done
would have saved him.

632
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,063
We always hoped
that he'd come back to us.

633
00:33:43,108 --> 00:33:44,196
And if he didn't,

634
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,980
we hoped that
someday we'd find him.

635
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,243
That's why you took on
the role of Supergirl.

636
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:50,115
She stands for hope.

637
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,508
But now that Dad's dead,

638
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:54,293
we know that there's no chance
of that ever happening.

639
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:57,470
And even if we were Supergirl
and we did find him,

640
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,168
it wouldn't change anything.

641
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:02,997
His life was a result
of his choices.

642
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:04,520
Not ours.

643
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:07,741
But it's gonna be okay.

644
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,092
Because in the real world,

645
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:13,877
we still have people
who love us

646
00:34:13,921 --> 00:34:16,880
and who wanna help us
make the changes we can.

647
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:20,797
Unlike here, where everyone
is trying to lock us in.

648
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,802
Don't listen to her, Supergirl.

649
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,595
You're leaving us no choice.

650
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:38,989
Hey.

651
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,167
Alex.

652
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,343
Get away from her, please.

653
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:45,605
She's dangerous.

654
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:49,130
Don't let her put
crazy thoughts in your head.

655
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,567
-She's not--
-This is your home.

656
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,655
We are your family.

657
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,788
You belong with us,
not with her.

658
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,008
That thing needs
to be destroyed.

659
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:02,622
If you can't... we will.

660
00:35:22,424 --> 00:35:23,425
Not in my reality.

661
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:30,563
Hey.

662
00:35:36,438 --> 00:35:37,265
End simulation.

663
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,234
Wait, no, no, no.
Hang on. Hang on.

664
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:54,195
How do I know
if I'm not in the VR still?

665
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:55,979
Because we had
a fight this morning

666
00:35:56,023 --> 00:35:57,024
that was never resolved.

667
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:00,549
Because your dad
is gone for good,

668
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:01,420
and you're sad.

669
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:03,422
But it's gonna be okay.

670
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,078
I know.

671
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:11,343
Yeah, I know that now.

672
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,223
I love you.

673
00:36:25,052 --> 00:36:27,010
Thank you
for not giving up on me.

674
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:27,924
I would never.

675
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,406
I'm so sorry.

676
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,193
I was such a jerk.

677
00:36:37,847 --> 00:36:39,240
And I pushed...

678
00:36:40,415 --> 00:36:43,723
J'onn and Kara and you away.

679
00:36:46,726 --> 00:36:50,382
You know, I've been so angry
at my dad for so long,

680
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:53,167
for abandoning
Kara and I,

681
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,039
for never reaching out,
you know?

682
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:58,172
But as hurt as I've been,

683
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,348
I just... I kept thinking

684
00:37:00,392 --> 00:37:02,655
that he would come back
into our lives someday.

685
00:37:02,698 --> 00:37:04,265
And then, you know,

686
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:06,920
I get the news
about his death, and I just...

687
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:11,359
I just got so mad at everyone.

688
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,190
But the reality...

689
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,281
is that I was just
mad at myself.

690
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:25,025
'Cause I couldn't save him.

691
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:28,463
And so I...

692
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:30,726
I felt...

693
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,293
I felt hopeless.

694
00:37:32,337 --> 00:37:33,903
You are not hopeless.

695
00:37:34,774 --> 00:37:35,949
You are a warrior.

696
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:44,000
What's wrong?

697
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,959
I think there's a lot
more going on

698
00:37:46,002 --> 00:37:48,353
in the VR than we know about.

699
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:51,530
Because I don't think
I was the only one
that was lost in there.

700
00:37:51,573 --> 00:37:55,360
There... There was a woman
named, uh, Bonnie,

701
00:37:55,403 --> 00:37:57,318
and there was a guy, Derek.

702
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,453
And... and I think
they were stuck in there, too.

703
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:03,803
And if there was
three of us...

704
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:06,327
then there could be
a lot more.

705
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:08,764
Um...

706
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,506
Okay, I... I... I'm on it.

707
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:16,381
Um, but first, we need
to get you to Midvale.

708
00:38:16,816 --> 00:38:17,773
Okay?

709
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:22,387
Yeah.

710
00:38:24,214 --> 00:38:24,998
Yeah, we do.

711
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,350
Lex Luthor
arrived in Madrid today

712
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,873
to a sellout crowd

713
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,440
to discuss Obsidian North's
new Platinum...

714
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:33,398
Cocky bastard.

715
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:34,877
Pre-orders are so high,

716
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,705
the phone lines have
currently shut down.

717
00:38:36,749 --> 00:38:38,359
-People are hailing
Lex Luthor

718
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,230
as the innovator
of the millennium.

719
00:38:40,274 --> 00:38:41,754
Nice work, Arnie.

720
00:38:41,797 --> 00:38:42,798
Promininant tech giants

721
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,539
are leaping onto the VR scene,

722
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,542
each driving forward new
and upcoming product lines.

723
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:51,067
However, nothing will
come close to Platinum VR.

724
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:54,375
If you think you kind of
understand what's going on
in tech today...

725
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:04,080
Thank you, Kelly.
I'm glad that Alex was okay.

726
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,300
Yes. Bye.

727
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:22,360
You've reached
Gemma Cooper's office.

728
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:24,710
Miss Cooper is not available
right now. But if you
leave your name--

729
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,675
I need a full
diagnostic write-up

730
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,894
on the failsafe error code.

731
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:37,287
And I want a patch
worked up immediately.

732
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:39,812
Nothing else moves forward
until this is done.

733
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:42,031
-Do you understand?
- Yes, Miss Rojas.

734
00:40:58,194 --> 00:40:59,500
Lex Luthor.

735
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,197
What are you up to?

736
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:10,555
Jeremiah was a loving
and caring man.

737
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:13,514
It's what made him
a great partner,
a great friend

738
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,865
and... a great father.

739
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,477
He was brave
and compassionate.

740
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:24,177
He knew just what to say
to make your life brighter,

741
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,876
how to pick you up
when you were feeling down.

742
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,183
In spite of all
the twists and turns

743
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,489
that Jeremiah's life took,

744
00:41:33,229 --> 00:41:37,016
the kindness,
compassion and love...

745
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,367
that was real.

746
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,151
I'm sorry for all the things
that I said.

747
00:41:42,195 --> 00:41:42,978
It doesn't matter.

748
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:45,807
You're here now.
