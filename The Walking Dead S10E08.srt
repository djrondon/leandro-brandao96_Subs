1
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:19,410
I don't care
if you're new to us.

2
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,719
I don't care
what your past was.

3
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:26,983
We all have a past.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,072
None of that matters now.

5
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:41,302
You did well at the barn.

6
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,956
Now I need something more.

7
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:48,613
Eyes and ears
inside their walls.

8
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,400
You are the kind of man
they'll trust.

9
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:58,667
Practical, loyal, smart.

10
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:03,237
And my daughter
doesn't know you.

11
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,767
Where should I start?

12
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,334
Ugh!

13
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:18,730
Find some strangers
and join them.

14
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:31,656
Help!

15
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,615
-Come on! Let's move!
-Help me!

16
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,356
-Walkers!
-Walkers! Move!

17
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:36,226
Help me!

18
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,228
-He's over here!
-Help me!

19
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,970
Help me!

20
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,027
Alpha:
Go to their gate.

21
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,945
They won't turn you away.

22
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,296
How you doing?

23
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:03,993
Hey, roll your sleeve up
for me, please.

24
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:05,299
Oh, yeah, sure.

25
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:06,604
There we go.

26
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:13,045
Make them think
you're at home...

27
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:17,006
...but never forget
your real one.

28
00:02:28,757 --> 00:02:35,242
Push quietly against their
weaknesses until they crumble.

29
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,578
Alpha: Do all this,

30
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:12,104
and we will welcome you home
when they fall.

31
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:15,412
You'll have a special place
among us.

32
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:21,565
Siddiq, are you awake?

33
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:24,916
Hola.

34
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,528
Bueno.

35
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,012
Siddiq and I
were talking about

36
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,188
how he's not sleeping much.

37
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,238
We're having
a hot romance.

38
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,196
Didn't you know?

39
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,333
Nah, we were just hanging,
and he got called out.

40
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:52,292
Something about, uh,

41
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,817
Andy and Donna's kid
throwing up.

42
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,384
I didn't ask
for details.

43
00:04:57,427 --> 00:05:00,343
Okay.

44
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,563
Lo siento, pero
you just missed him.

45
00:05:03,912 --> 00:05:05,566
Mm.

46
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:18,579
No.

47
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:19,971
Rosita.

48
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,715
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

49
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,370
Okay. Okay.

50
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:29,067
There you go.

51
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,744
Alright. It's okay.
No.

52
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,093
It's okay.
No.

53
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:57,357
In nature, sometimes
parents eat their young.

54
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:08,716
Ahh!

55
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,067
No!

56
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,028
No!

57
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,338
Oh!

58
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:42,010
It's okay. It's okay.

59
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:43,925
It's okay. It's okay.

60
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,448
It's okay. It's okay.

61
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,407
It's okay.

62
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,322
I know.

63
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:51,802
I know.

64
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:58,695
You alright?

65
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,611
Is the baby still alive?

66
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:04,527
The baby that was rescued
at Hilltop?

67
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,311
Y-Yes.

68
00:08:07,182 --> 00:08:10,011
He's my nephew.

69
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:12,100
Oh.

70
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,232
I didn't know that.

71
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,238
Did you ever name him?

72
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,675
My sister didn't.

73
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,459
She couldn't.

74
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,548
The family raising himnamed him Adam.

75
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,724
Can I see him?

76
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,206
Your people
left him to die.

77
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,469
Why would we ever agreeto that?

78
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,689
Because we can trade.

79
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:37,429
I have information
for you.

80
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:38,430
What is it?

81
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:39,736
Promise me I can see him.

82
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,956
I can't promise you
anything.

83
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:45,002
I'll listen to what you have,see if it's true,

84
00:08:45,046 --> 00:08:46,526
and then we can talk.

85
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,573
He's the only family
I have left.

86
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,749
Well, then,you better tell the truth.

87
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,316
Without your mask.

88
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:14,684
Before all this,
my name was Mary.

89
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,601
Hi, Mary.

90
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,821
What do you wanna tell me?

91
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,694
Hope that hurts.

92
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,572
It doesn't matter.

93
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,140
None of this matters.

94
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,447
Watch enough peopleget incinerated, devoured alive,

95
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,624
you see how ridiculous it is
getting attached to ourselves.

96
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,626
But knowing that
sets you free.

97
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,801
Is that
what you're doing?

98
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:46,107
Setting us free?

99
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,762
If you learn that lesson,
it'll only help you.

100
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,678
What, so we can be
more like you?

101
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,028
Accept the future.Gabriel:Siddiq depended on you.

102
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:56,073
Why put him throughall that hell in the barn

103
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,335
just to kill him
months later?

104
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,337
I-I can't see an ideologybehind that.

105
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:01,383
I liked Siddiq.

106
00:10:01,426 --> 00:10:03,167
Oh, you liked him?

107
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,781
He wasn't part
of the plan.

108
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:12,133
But he found out who I was,
so I had no choice.

109
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:13,656
What plan?

110
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,790
Encourage your paranoia
about us...

111
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:20,315
which will push you
into bad decisions.

112
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,230
Places like this

113
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,710
are cruel promises
to their people,

114
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,800
and they crumble
at the smallest nick.

115
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:30,847
Hell, I'm gonna enjoy watching
you rip each other apart

116
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,109
over what to do with me.

117
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:34,764
Just like with Negan.

118
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,637
Is that what you want?A public reckoning?

119
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,421
A chance to be heard?

120
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:41,815
That's what you'll give me.

121
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,077
Because it's right.

122
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,689
We helped you.Why?

123
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,865
'Cause you wanted
another doctor around?

124
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:51,172
You got something
from me, too.

125
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,695
Don't pretend you didn't.

126
00:10:55,045 --> 00:11:00,050
No one is actually kind.

127
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,705
We are selfish.

128
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:04,054
We are brutal.

129
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,013
Come on.

130
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:07,754
Even seeing all those heads
on spikes

131
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,277
didn't teach you
what people are?

132
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,853
He's been here
four months.

133
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,683
How didn't I know?

134
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,512
None of us did.

135
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,863
We all ate together.

136
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,692
Talked about
training the militia.

137
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:36,913
He treated Gracie.

138
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:38,785
You can't do that
to yourself.

139
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,264
Yeah.
Especially now.

140
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:41,396
We gotta keep our heads
straight,

141
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,224
try to figure out
what's going on.

142
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:50,448
Mary, the Whisperer
I've been talking to, um,

143
00:11:50,492 --> 00:11:52,712
told me where Alpha
is keeping the herd.

144
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,325
Just over the border,
on their side.

145
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,935
It's this sunken field

146
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,676
on the edge
of the national forest.

147
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,547
We can leave
right after the funeral.

148
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,767
We're gonna trust
a Whisperer now?

149
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,900
You wanna do nothing?Lydia's still gone.

150
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,816
We don't even knowwhat that means yet.

151
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,818
Alpha doesn't know that.

152
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,864
With Dante locked up in a cell,
she never has to.

153
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:17,867
We ain't gonna talk abouthow this is probably an ambush?

154
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:22,785
Well, the baby
that Connie rescued --

155
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:24,613
apparently
that's Mary's nephew.

156
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:27,050
She wants to see him.

157
00:12:27,094 --> 00:12:28,095
I don't think she's lying.

158
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:29,487
Alright.

159
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,794
Get a group from Hilltopand meet us there.

160
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:34,014
Second we're done, we're goinglooking for the girl.

161
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,363
Yeah. I'll radio them.

162
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,234
Maybe they can get the news
to Michonne, too.

163
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,323
Alright.

164
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,805
Hey.

165
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,068
Why don't you stay here?I'll go.

166
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:46,461
Why?

167
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,116
You gonna tell mewhat really happened out there?

168
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,945
I told you.
Lydia didn't want to come back.

169
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:53,207
I couldn't make her.

170
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,862
Her being here protects us.You know that.

171
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,386
So, that's it for her now,
to be our shield?

172
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,997
Just lock her up again?

173
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,998
I showed
one of Alpha's people

174
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,260
that their leader
lied to them,

175
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:04,522
and that's good for us.

176
00:13:04,566 --> 00:13:06,829
We can push on
their wounds, too.

177
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,788
You stillshould have told me.

178
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:10,006
I'll help you look for her,

179
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,834
but I don't think
she wants to be found.

180
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,576
Are we talking about her,or are we talking about you?

181
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,549
Whoa.

182
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:32,986
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

183
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,959
What do you see?

184
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,874
I'm not as good a trackeras Daryl,

185
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:55,747
but those printslook recent and clean,

186
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,575
not dragging
like a walker.

187
00:13:57,619 --> 00:13:59,795
Whisperers
don't travel alone,

188
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,362
so it's gotta be
somebody else.

189
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,886
Could beone of their scouts.

190
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,105
The longer
we spend out here,

191
00:14:05,148 --> 00:14:08,238
the more likely we are
to bump into them.

192
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:12,286
If it's just one scout,
I like our chances.

193
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:18,118
But we have to be
as quiet as possible.

194
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,902
Right?

195
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,470
Yup, that was meant for me.Let's go.

196
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:24,167
I take no offense.

197
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,996
I am here as a representative
of Hilltop

198
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,869
as a soldier of peace
and justice.

199
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,088
Or you wanna see
Jules.

200
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:32,959
What?

201
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:35,091
Stop it.

202
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:37,006
What were you whistlingbefore?

203
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,922
I'm glad
you asked me that.

204
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,925
I'm whistling one
of the most whistle-able --

205
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:45,058
is that even a word? --
it is now --

206
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,147
whistle-able sections

207
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,933
of Rachmaninoff's variations
on a theme of Paganini.

208
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:53,631
It's like one of the greatest
pieces of music ever.

209
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:55,068
It's my favorite.

210
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:59,202
And I can only hear it
in my head nowadays.

211
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:02,162
I wanna write that down, butyou've gotta spell it, please.

212
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,773
I got you.
What do you got here?

213
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,514
A record of everythingthat happens to us.

214
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:08,472
Our stories
for the future.

215
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:10,431
Really?

216
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:11,823
Oh.

217
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,173
Well, maybe
I can help you out.

218
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,957
If you wanna do
a great personal history,

219
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,480
you've gotta read a little.

220
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:22,225
And this road leads right
through Waterford, right?

221
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:24,575
And I remember they had a
really excellent library there.

222
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,622
Maybe we want to stop
and pick up some inspiration.

223
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,189
What do you say, Ma?

224
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:30,712
We really shouldn't.

225
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:33,062
Come on, please, Mom?

226
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,717
I've read almost every bookin Alexandria.

227
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:06,008
Russian-English dictionary
for Eugene.

228
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:07,009
Satellite parts.

229
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:10,056
Okay, smart one.

230
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,014
I'm gonna go check out
their music section.

231
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:16,149
Just 'cause, you know,
we're here.

232
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:20,153
I'll go see if there's
anything worth taking.

233
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:34,994
Mm.

234
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,826
I always wanted
to read this.

235
00:16:43,872 --> 00:16:45,352
Maybe we can read ittogether?

236
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:47,528
Magna: Hilltop to Michonne.

237
00:16:47,571 --> 00:16:49,051
Are you there?

238
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,272
This is Michonne.

239
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,664
It's Magna.

240
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:57,233
I'm relaying a message to you
from Alexandria.

241
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,583
Michonne and Judith
are listening.

242
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,020
What happened?

243
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,164
Aha, yes!

244
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,692
Yo.

245
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:23,172
Yo.

246
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:26,132
Here we go.

247
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:28,612
Ahh!

248
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,759
Ohh!

249
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:54,682
Oh!

250
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,813
Damn it!

251
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,426
Help!

252
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,521
Hey!
W-What's your name, man?

253
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:09,305
Huh? What's your name?

254
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:10,306
What -- Wait!

255
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,396
Thank you! Ah!

256
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,490
Hey!

257
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,058
What's your name, man?!What happened?

258
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,364
This guy just came in
out of nowhere.

259
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,409
He saved my life.
He just ran out!

260
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,107
Who the hell does that?!

261
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,458
Maybe you can catch him.
Ohh!

262
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:37,159
Who in the hell
does that, man?

263
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,466
And leave
all his stuff here?

264
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:41,642
Just runs off?

265
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:42,904
What the hell?

266
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,906
That's a good book.

267
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,603
You should keep that one.

268
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,171
We'll take all of it.

269
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,825
Hey, I'm sorry.

270
00:18:50,868 --> 00:18:52,870
Is everything alright?

271
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,226
Siddiq is dead.

272
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,402
So, no,
not everything is okay.

273
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,492
We have to get to Oceanside
and get back home now.

274
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,940
I remember this passage
from my studies.

275
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,376
Written by a scholar
centuries ago

276
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,989
who was trying to understand
the impossible --

277
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:29,168
"Let me live
if life is better for me

278
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:33,476
and take my life
if death is better for me."

279
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,348
He had surrendered himself
to fate

280
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:38,220
because his world
defied logic.

281
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,744
Defied justice.

282
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,060
We created you from it...

283
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,412
...and return you into it...

284
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:02,113
...and from it we will
raise you a second time.

285
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,330
Hi.

286
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:46,114
Hi.

287
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:47,463
It's good to see you.

288
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:51,162
You too.

289
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:56,516
I can't believe
he's gone.

290
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,387
I don't know why, but...

291
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:02,478
Never mind.

292
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:03,958
What?

293
00:21:04,001 --> 00:21:07,353
He was one of those peopleI thought would live forever.

294
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,140
Not really, but you know.

295
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:17,188
Too many things
are changing.

296
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:20,931
How long are you staying?

297
00:21:20,975 --> 00:21:23,586
Maybe a day or two.

298
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,241
I'm sorry.
I wish I had more time.

299
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,330
It's okay.

300
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,594
I hear you might have foundAlpha's herd.

301
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,423
You need help?

302
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:36,338
No, we have
enough people.

303
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:42,344
Everything else okay?

304
00:21:46,566 --> 00:21:49,220
Good luck.

305
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,311
Thanks.

306
00:22:41,316 --> 00:22:42,796
No!

307
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,120
Ohh!

308
00:23:12,782 --> 00:23:15,176
Thanks.

309
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:18,484
No expressions of
gratitude required.

310
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:21,095
I was only relieved I happened
to be crossing through

311
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:22,705
on my way ho--

312
00:23:24,054 --> 00:23:26,187
On my way back
to my domicile.

313
00:23:27,188 --> 00:23:30,539
You almost said "home."

314
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,627
No.

315
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,327
Yes.

316
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:42,595
My deepest condolences,
Rosita.

317
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:45,685
Siddiq's passing was
an incomprehensible tragedy.

318
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:47,991
I only wish there was
more I could offer

319
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,079
than to pay my respects

320
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,646
and to bash

321
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,388
a few vexatious walkers

322
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,824
in their
flame-blistered crania.

323
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:59,612
Well...

324
00:23:59,655 --> 00:24:02,484
travel safe.

325
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:06,880
I mean, I'm -- I'm the one
who's gonna be traveling.

326
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:17,107
Man: Who were you before?

327
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:21,242
I was a doctor, a father.

328
00:24:21,285 --> 00:24:23,636
I was trying to get by.

329
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:30,556
How long did you know
the people you came in with?

330
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,035
Months, I don't know.

331
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,733
I lost track of time.

332
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:34,864
They saved my life.

333
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,345
I was dying
out in the woods.

334
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:38,912
Who was your leader?

335
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,566
We didn't --

336
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,743
How many people
have you killed?

337
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:47,486
Only man I ever killed
tried to hurt my son.

338
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:50,619
But walkers got Jimmy
in the end, anyway.

339
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:13,599
What happened?

340
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:18,560
I was helping Eugenewith some walkers at the gates.

341
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:19,779
How's sweet pea?

342
00:25:19,822 --> 00:25:22,521
Fast asleep.

343
00:25:26,786 --> 00:25:28,875
You know,that wasn't the truth.

344
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:31,225
Um...

345
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:32,618
I wasn't helping Eugene.

346
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,011
He was helping me.

347
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,970
Okay.
I just --

348
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:41,452
I should be ableto handle walkers like that.

349
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:42,671
I always could before.

350
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:45,456
It's been a rough day,
Rosita.

351
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,806
No, it's not that.

352
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,246
I could die.

353
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,817
I used to think that,if it happened, it happened.

354
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:03,170
But now that wouldmake Coco an orphan.

355
00:26:07,348 --> 00:26:09,785
And I cannot die.

356
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:14,703
I'm afraid.

357
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,053
And that feeling
isn't going away.

358
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:19,621
Well feelings don't predict
the future.

359
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,928
That sounds like a quotefrom somewhere else.

360
00:26:21,971 --> 00:26:23,886
We need to focus
on the problem in front of us.

361
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,192
It's my responsibility to --

362
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,497
If I freeze again --

363
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,064
You won't.

364
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:29,631
You're not listening.

365
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,807
I have to figure out
how this happened to us.

366
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,809
Council members are talking
to Jen and Wayne now,

367
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,724
and I need to get over there.
We need to find Lydia.

368
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:37,944
We need to find out
why she didn't know Dante.

369
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,685
We need to find out --Did you hear what I said?

370
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,861
You needed help
with a walker,

371
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:42,992
and now you think
you'll keep needing help,

372
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,299
but I'm saying
the feeling will pass.

373
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,265
Maybe Dante was rightabout us.

374
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,488
We're not as strong
as we think we are.

375
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,671
Alright. If you get
two more right, you win.

376
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:12,587
Pick easy ones.No way, Jose.

377
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,198
Okay, let's see. Uh.

378
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:17,287
Capital of Missouri.

379
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,420
Jefferson City.

380
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:20,377
Amazing.

381
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,814
Uh...

382
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:22,858
capital
of South Dakota.

383
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:24,077
Pierre.

384
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,646
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.

385
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:28,821
That's amazing.

386
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:29,996
It's good.

387
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,040
Okay. Choose.

388
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:32,520
I want a story
about California.

389
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,914
Capital, Sacramento.

390
00:27:34,957 --> 00:27:36,524
California.

391
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:37,525
Okay.

392
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:39,919
Let's see.

393
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:43,923
Okay, um,
summer after college,

394
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:45,707
I was hiking near Eureka

395
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,970
with this man
I was in love with.

396
00:27:48,014 --> 00:27:49,755
And we were way high up
in the forest.

397
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:54,716
We found these old ruins
from a Native American village

398
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,892
from hundreds of years ago.

399
00:27:56,936 --> 00:28:01,549
And we stood there
in the middle of the village

400
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:04,073
and just listened to the sound
of the ocean waves

401
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:06,902
crashing on the beach
from far away.

402
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,861
And we tried to imagine,
you know,

403
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,819
what those people
were like

404
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:15,911
who were now, um,
um, lost to time.

405
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:20,220
These were people who had
their own laws and beliefs

406
00:28:20,263 --> 00:28:23,876
and hopes for the future
of their own village.

407
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:28,619
You know, I was one
of the very first people

408
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:30,578
here in Alexandria,

409
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:33,755
back when it started,
back when we --

410
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,976
we thought we knew
what it was going to be.

411
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:41,763
And recently, I've been
thinking more and more

412
00:28:41,807 --> 00:28:42,721
about that village.

413
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,027
What happened
to those people?

414
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:48,465
I don't know.

415
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:01,783
Michonne: When was the last timeyou had new people in here?

416
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:03,132
Rachel:
Since way before the fire.

417
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:07,441
Dante showed up in Alexandriaway before the fire.

418
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:08,790
We can't use that
as a marker

419
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,532
of Alpha's return anymore.

420
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,751
Whatever process
you were using

421
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,969
to vetyour newest people here,

422
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:15,492
you have to put themthrough a different one.

423
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:18,060
Man: Ahh! No! No!

424
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:22,848
-What's going on?
-Aah! No! No!

425
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:24,980
N-No! No!

426
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:26,416
How did you get in here?

427
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,940
-Come on, come on!

428
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,812
-Who the hell are you?
-He was trying to steal a sail.

429
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,771
And then probably
also a boat.

430
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,990
Let me go!Where did you come from?

431
00:29:35,034 --> 00:29:37,819
Let me go.
Don't touch me!

432
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:40,169
I swear to God,I'm not gonna ask you again.

433
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:46,828
I'm just trying
to get home.

434
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:49,396
I don't want to cause
any trouble.

435
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,877
I just wanna get back
to my family.

436
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,055
Michonne...This is the guy.
This is the guy.

437
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:57,883
He saved my life at the library.How you doing, pal?

438
00:29:57,926 --> 00:29:59,493
And also the guy that's beensneaking around,

439
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:00,929
messing withthe security system.

440
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:03,845
In the past, we've hung men
for less than that.

441
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,456
And he might be
a Whisperer.

442
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,894
O-Okay. H-Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

443
00:30:08,937 --> 00:30:11,722
He was taking books.

444
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:13,986
He -- He has a pictureof his family.

445
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,988
He's got a bag full of stuff.Does that seem like a Whisperer?

446
00:30:16,031 --> 00:30:18,251
We don't know what a Whisperer
looks like anymore, Luke.

447
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:21,080
Come on.
Let me go.

448
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:25,258
You're gonna answer
our questions.

449
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:27,651
Who are your people?

450
00:30:29,915 --> 00:30:31,917
Cyndie:
They breached the fence!

451
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,092
Hold him!

452
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:36,922
Watch their hands!

453
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:55,897
Judith!

454
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:18,964
Did you even have a son?

455
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:22,968
Why does that matter?

456
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:27,320
I guess it doesn't.

457
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:30,062
It was one of the things
I liked about you.

458
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:36,677
That my son was killed?

459
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,896
That you had a family.

460
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:43,379
I suppose you'd like me to
never trust anyone ever again.

461
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,951
It's a meaningless idea.

462
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:17,936
Is that what you're here
to show us?

463
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,895
Look around you, Gabriel.

464
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,941
Look what people didto the world.

465
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,858
And you think
we can be good?

466
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:30,687
You think we deservea second chance?

467
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:34,082
I loved Siddiq
like a brother.

468
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:39,087
My family will never be
the same now.

469
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,046
His daughter
will never know him.

470
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:44,701
Maybe Rosita will blame me,
and maybe she's right to.

471
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:46,051
I didn't protect them
enough.

472
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:49,228
I...

473
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:50,969
I haven't always
been brave.

474
00:32:57,932 --> 00:33:00,195
Do we deserve
a second chance?

475
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,157
I don't know.

476
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,074
But sometimes we get one,
anyway.

477
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:21,390
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

478
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,785
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

479
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,569
Ahh!

480
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,314
No! No!

481
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,579
Ohh!

482
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:24,410
Don't move.

483
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,507
Mom!

484
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,335
Over here!

485
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:48,999
Good girl.

486
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:59,097
You will grow tall,

487
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,316
and you will
grow strong.

488
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,364
You will know safety...

489
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,280
...and family...

490
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:10,151
and home.

491
00:35:46,318 --> 00:35:49,973
-Hi.
-Hey, D.

492
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,803
-Good to see you.
-You too.

493
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:55,805
-Good to see you.
-Mm.

494
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:59,331
How's Rosita?
As expected.

495
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:02,508
Let's get to it.
Screw these freaks.

496
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,120
I say that
in Siddiq's honor.

497
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:10,168
Thanks for helping.

498
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:14,710
Hey. Wait.

499
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,279
Coulda lost a foot.

500
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,847
They laid traps.Means we're getting closer.

501
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:22,805
I saw something over there.

502
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,981
Will you stop this shit?

503
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,287
Please.

504
00:37:28,158 --> 00:37:29,464
You want her dead so bad,

505
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:31,205
you don't even care
what happens to you.

506
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,381
That's not true.

507
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:36,515
You never
came off that boat.

508
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:39,431
It's been like talking
to a goddamn ghost.

509
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:44,174
I'm doing the best I can.

510
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:47,090
I'm the one you tell.

511
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:48,527
Me.

512
00:37:52,357 --> 00:37:54,837
I don't -- I don't know how.

513
00:37:54,881 --> 00:37:58,972
You gotta try, alright?

514
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,193
Come here.

515
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:14,553
She's not worth it.

516
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:19,688
She's not.

517
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:21,603
Look at me.

518
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:27,043
She's a dead woman,
anyway.

519
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,045
We have a future.

520
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:30,960
Don't let her
take that, too.

521
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,009
Yes.

522
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,492
You good?

523
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,147
Yeah.

524
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:51,024
Alright.

525
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,505
I'll get this.

526
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:22,594
Don't go through my stuff.

527
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:26,641
That book belongs
to my daughter.

528
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,513
I wasn't.

529
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:30,558
The book fell out,
and I picked it up for you.

530
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,473
And it clearly belongs
to the library.

531
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:37,043
It's for my daughter.

532
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:38,218
Put it back.

533
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,487
Be careful.

534
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,577
You'll rip
your stitches.

535
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,843
You comfortable?

536
00:40:58,717 --> 00:40:59,979
Judith...

537
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,242
give us a minute.

538
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:23,393
So...

539
00:41:23,437 --> 00:41:25,395
what are you
really doing here?

540
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,838
Your daughter's a little demonwith a sword.

541
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,143
Yeah.

542
00:41:34,187 --> 00:41:37,669
Like mother,
like daughter.

543
00:41:37,712 --> 00:41:40,541
Only mine wouldn't leave
anything to heal.

544
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,720
Now answer
my damn question.

545
00:41:46,765 --> 00:41:50,333
Didn't mean it
in a bad way.

546
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,727
No way you make it
this long

547
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:56,252
without being comfortablewith violence.

548
00:41:56,296 --> 00:42:00,430
Now, how long
have you been watching us?

549
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:02,128
I'm not watching you.

550
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:04,347
I don't want to hurtanybody here.

551
00:42:06,393 --> 00:42:09,614
I left home for supplies,

552
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,703
and now I'm just tryingto get back.

553
00:42:11,746 --> 00:42:13,400
I swear.

554
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:16,664
Why'd you help
my friend?

555
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:18,231
Is that
a part of the play?

556
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:20,842
No. No.
There is no play.

557
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,980
I don't know.
I just did it.

558
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:32,462
He needed help.

559
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:38,643
Even with what might happento me here, glad I did it.

560
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:45,650
Mercy's in short supplythese days.

561
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:49,784
I don't expect it.

562
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:51,438
Maybe I don't deserve it.

563
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:01,056
Something wrong?

564
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,406
You just reminded me
of something

565
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,626
a friend of mine
used to say.

566
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:11,501
What's that?

567
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,900
"My mercy prevails
over my wrath."

568
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:48,364
Okay.

569
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,454
So, you're trying
to get home.

570
00:43:56,372 --> 00:43:58,723
Just tell me
where that is.

571
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:02,378
I can't tell you
where I live.

572
00:44:02,422 --> 00:44:03,684
My family's there.

573
00:44:03,728 --> 00:44:06,252
This is how you get
back to them.

574
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:09,037
Or keep them safe.

575
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:12,867
Your wife and kids
don't know where you are

576
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,522
or whether you're
ever gonna come back.

577
00:44:15,565 --> 00:44:18,133
Don't put them
through that.

578
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:29,492
I live on Bloodsworth Islandin Tangier Sound.

579
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:34,672
Hard to find...

580
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:36,238
and fortified.

581
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,245
Like I said, I didn't meanto break in, cause any chaos,

582
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:46,031
but I needed a boat
on your pier.

583
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:51,819
Well,
good intentions or not,

584
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:54,779
you owe them
for all that damage,

585
00:44:54,822 --> 00:44:57,738
and you're not going anywhere
until we figure that out.

586
00:44:57,782 --> 00:45:00,393
You have enemies to fight.

587
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:06,094
Maybe we can help
each other out.

588
00:45:08,096 --> 00:45:10,403
What do you mean?

589
00:45:20,282 --> 00:45:21,893
What'd he tell you?

590
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:26,419
He lives on a naval base,

591
00:45:26,462 --> 00:45:28,334
an island about
two days from here.

592
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:34,688
Could be weapons big enoughto kill a herd.

593
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,865
Take out Alpha
once and for all.

594
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,214
And he'd just
let you have 'em?

595
00:45:39,258 --> 00:45:41,869
Oh, yeah.

596
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:45,003
Then I need to find a wayto bring them back.

597
00:45:47,832 --> 00:45:50,530
So, what's wrong?

598
00:45:50,573 --> 00:45:53,838
It would have to be me...

599
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:57,232
just metaking that kind of risk.

600
00:45:59,452 --> 00:46:02,281
But also...

601
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:04,936
I should get back.

602
00:46:04,979 --> 00:46:07,329
With everything happeningat home, we should be together.

603
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:08,940
Fighting together.

604
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:17,165
But this
could end the war.

605
00:46:17,209 --> 00:46:19,037
Right?

606
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,343
Maybe.

607
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:26,479
I have to find out.

608
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:33,660
It's okay, Mom.

609
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,227
You do.

610
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:42,147
We can't lose anyone else.

611
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,266
God damn it!

612
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:16,094
-Wait.
-For what?

613
00:47:16,137 --> 00:47:17,530
Aaron: This doesn't mean
Mary lied to us, alright?

614
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:19,140
They were protecting
this place.

615
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:20,881
T-They put a trap in the road
as a deterrent.

616
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,100
Yeah, from some huntera decade ago.

617
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,275
No. That thing was rigged

618
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,103
more recently than that,
and you know it.

619
00:47:25,146 --> 00:47:27,192
You wanna stand aroundand figure it out?

620
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:31,849
Look, the herd could have been
here last week or yesterday.

621
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,676
We had an obligation
to come check this out.

622
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,201
Nah.
Time to find Lydia.

623
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:38,029
Let's go.

624
00:47:43,208 --> 00:47:45,906
I know everything's
upside down right now,

625
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,691
but I wasn't wrong
about this.

626
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:12,063
I negotiated
with Rachel.

627
00:48:12,106 --> 00:48:14,935
Whatever weapons you have
on your island

628
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,285
will pay off your debt.

629
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,852
I'll take you home,

630
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,288
and I'll bring the boat
back to them.

631
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:28,557
Can't be that simple.

632
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:30,995
Or thank you.

633
00:48:31,038 --> 00:48:33,301
You're welcome.

634
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:34,781
Up to you.

635
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:38,089
Can I have my stuff back?

636
00:49:02,678 --> 00:49:04,245
I'm Virgil.

637
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:08,989
Michonne.

638
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:10,121
Man:
Yeah, we're gonna need...

639
00:49:10,164 --> 00:49:11,949
Fill everyone in
back home.

640
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:15,778
I am just a walkie call away
if they need anything.

641
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,998
I'm only a couple days
behind you.

642
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,217
I'll make sure
the council knows

643
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,219
what you're about to
bring home.

644
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:23,699
We'll have people ready
with wagons, if you need.

645
00:49:23,743 --> 00:49:25,049
Just keep us posted.

646
00:49:25,092 --> 00:49:27,573
Michonne,I don't want you to worry.

647
00:49:27,616 --> 00:49:29,140
We got Judith
looking after us.

648
00:49:33,927 --> 00:49:35,189
Keep her safe.

649
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:37,191
I will.

650
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:46,809
Now, it doesn't have to be
an emergency

651
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:49,464
for you to check in,
okay?

652
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,162
You can do that every day.

653
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:54,513
Or...

654
00:49:56,428 --> 00:49:58,821
...every hour.

655
00:50:00,127 --> 00:50:02,521
Roger.
Over and out.

656
00:50:06,873 --> 00:50:08,396
I'll see you soon.

657
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:14,185
Be good for Uncle Daryl.

658
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:51,222
Daryl: Lydia would have taken
this river downstream.

659
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:52,875
Back to our side.

660
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:58,316
Hey.

661
00:50:58,359 --> 00:50:59,839
Carol, let's go.

662
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:01,188
You go on.
I'll meet you.

663
00:51:01,232 --> 00:51:03,495
Nope.
We all stay together.

664
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:26,344
Hey!

665
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:30,348
Carol!

666
00:52:20,311 --> 00:52:21,747
Go! Get her ass
out of there!

667
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,323
Carol!
