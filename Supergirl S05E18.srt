1
00:00:02,872 --> 00:00:04,700
Inhale, tadassana...

2
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:08,008
Exhale. Padmasana.

3
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,749
Again. Inhale, tadassana...

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:14,057
Exhale. Padmasana.

5
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,886
And as we close
our practice,

6
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,670
let us thank
Lena Luthor

7
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:21,891
for freeing us from rage
and for bringing us peace.

8
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,721
-Namaste.
- Namaste.

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,905
What's going on?

10
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,559
Wh... Why won't
the doors open?

11
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:39,517
The solar event must've
knocked the power out.

12
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,042
I can't breathe.

13
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:43,173
I think
he's claustrophobic.

14
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,915
I got
to get out of here!

15
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,766
Is that our invitation
to the Leviathan ship?

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,421
I really have to put
a bell on you.

17
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:15,075
No, but I'm close.

18
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,078
I think Gemma Cooper
is warming to me.

19
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,384
And when she sees
my newest present,

20
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:21,777
she'll roll out
the red carpet.

21
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,648
Another present
like the Sun-Eater?

22
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:26,956
I'm a twelfth level
intellect.

23
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:29,132
Did you really think
I wouldn't connect the dots?

24
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:32,831
-What's your point?
-Okay. I... I know
that you've been

25
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:35,399
cozying up to Gemma Cooper
for strategic reasons,

26
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,619
but there's a distinction
between manipulating

27
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:40,970
Leviathan and helping them
destroy the world!

28
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,973
What kind of operation
do you think this is?

29
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,627
Mr. Smith
Goes to Leviathan?

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,150
Sometimes, to get
what you want,

31
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,934
you have to play
a little dirty.

32
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:50,588
I cannot get
that invitation

33
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,416
unless they think
I'm on their side

34
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,939
and if that means
helping them get

35
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,593
a weapon or two,
so be it.

36
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:56,681
People could've died.

37
00:01:58,292 --> 00:01:59,467
My friends could've died.

38
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,991
Three months ago,
you said that Leviathan

39
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:03,471
was our biggest threat,

40
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,168
that if we didn't
defeat them,

41
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:07,953
the global repercussions
would be catastrophic.

42
00:02:07,997 --> 00:02:10,130
Millions dead,
us and the Supers included.

43
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,610
And your very words were,
"The only way

44
00:02:12,654 --> 00:02:14,482
that you could
successfully defeat them

45
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:18,094
was by working with me,
by trusting me."

46
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,879
So, trust me now...

47
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:23,491
because I know
what you're thinking.

48
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,189
You're thinking that
if you can get

49
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,799
the location
of the Leviathan ship

50
00:02:27,843 --> 00:02:29,453
before I get that invitation,

51
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:33,153
you can maybe end this
before anyone gets hurt.

52
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,720
But that's your anxiety
thinking, not logic.

53
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,637
I don't want
your friends to die either,

54
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,683
but sometimes,
for the greater good,

55
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:43,293
you have to break
a few super-eggs.

56
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:44,642
And you expect me
to just stand back

57
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:46,296
while Leviathan tries
to kill my friends?

58
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,343
I expect you
to trust the process.

59
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:53,695
War is brewing between
Leviathan and the Supers

60
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:56,088
and you are not
to intervene.

61
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:02,182
So, we tried
to find Leviathan's
last known location.

62
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,488
There's no trace,
no hidden signs,

63
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:07,230
no radiation.
Even the elevator was gone.

64
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,101
J'onn is out scanning
for any other signs

65
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,060
of Leviathan right now.

66
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:12,496
We don't even know
if their headquarters

67
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,020
are in National City
on this Earth.

68
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:16,544
Well, one thing
that we do know

69
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:20,374
is that Leviathan strikes
quickly after a failure.

70
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:24,029
I wish Brainy would give us
another crack at that Morae.

71
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,509
What I'd really like
to know is

72
00:03:25,553 --> 00:03:28,251
why Lena was at the Fortress
at the exact same time.

73
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,731
Myriad is a trigger
for Lena.

74
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:32,037
So, maybe her arrival
is a coincidence.

75
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,692
Like it was a coincidence
that Lex just heroed in

76
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,172
and saved all those
coma patients

77
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,219
the exact same day Leviathan
tried to destroy the sun?

78
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,699
No. Where there is smoke,
there is a Luthor.

79
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,571
Right now, we have
no reason to believe

80
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,268
that Lena is involved
with Leviathan.

81
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,052
We have no reason
to believe she isn't.

82
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,794
Okay. So, let's start
with something that we do know.

83
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,539
Rama Khan.

84
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,542
Except he hasn't been
seen on this Earth
for hundreds of years.

85
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:00,370
I can monitor for
unusual seismic activity

86
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:01,719
until J'onn gets back.

87
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,113
Rama Khan isn't
the only member of Leviathan.

88
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,549
So, we should search
for record

89
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,247
of any others
throughout history.

90
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,597
How can we do that
without the DEO's database?

91
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,468
Kelly's mentioned
an old military friend

92
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,731
who's an expert in
semiotics and iconography

93
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,255
and he's currently
an archivist

94
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,257
at the United States
Congressional Library.

95
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,563
So, I will ask her
to reach out to him

96
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:21,086
and maybe he can help.

97
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,566
I'll stay here,

98
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,394
see if I can't dream
of Leviathan's
new headquarters.

99
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,136
Good. Look,
we've stopped him before,

100
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,833
we can do it again.

101
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,358
And this time, we'll take down
both the Luthors and Leviathan.

102
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,930
So, the blackout provoked
the subject to have
some sort of episode?

103
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,105
No, I think something's
interfering with

104
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,542
his Non Nocere directive.

105
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:43,761
Do you think your BFF
messing with Myriad Q-waves

106
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,110
yesterday had anything
to do with it?

107
00:04:45,154 --> 00:04:46,460
That was the very
first thing I thought of,

108
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,765
but I checked and it didn't.

109
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,637
Well, even still,
I could have a bag

110
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,987
of Kryptonite dumplings
delivered to her door.

111
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,122
Mr. Luthor,

112
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,124
I didn't know you were
gonna be here, too.

113
00:04:59,168 --> 00:05:00,517
What an honor.

114
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,302
And I had no idea you...

115
00:05:03,477 --> 00:05:04,695
existed.

116
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,307
This is Steve Lomelli.
I asked him to come.

117
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,830
He was with Klaus
when he changed,

118
00:05:08,873 --> 00:05:11,485
but Steve's Non Nocere
directive is still intact.

119
00:05:11,528 --> 00:05:13,965
So, it was
an isolated incident.

120
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,794
Great. Just need to re-adjust
the Q-wave frequencies

121
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:19,667
and that should re-establish
Non Nocere.

122
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,234
Don't worry.
I turned the sun red.

123
00:05:22,278 --> 00:05:24,324
I think we can fix
one broken inmate.

124
00:05:27,675 --> 00:05:30,852
Imagine a place where
there's only peace,

125
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,507
connection, unity,

126
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,465
where we can connect
with everyone,

127
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,033
past, present and future,

128
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:40,688
where a lost loved one
can stand by your side

129
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:42,211
once more.

130
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:46,520
I give you Obsidian North's
greatest VR achievement,

131
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,697
the Obsidian Worldwide
Unity Festival.

132
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:56,181
An Obsidian employee
kidnaps hundreds of users

133
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,879
and the next day,
we're planning

134
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:00,490
a Live Aid 2020.

135
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,883
If Margot Morrison had
anything to do

136
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,364
with the glitch
that trapped Alex,

137
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,540
who knows what else
she may have planted.

138
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,237
Great. Everyone, thank you.
That'll be it.

139
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:15,200
-Andrea.
-Kelly. Isn't this exciting?

140
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:16,506
We're obviously
working late tonight.

141
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,290
I was thinking Thai.
There's so much to do.

142
00:06:18,334 --> 00:06:21,206
Andrea, we are not
in a position to launch

143
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,251
such a massive event.

144
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:23,731
After what we just
went through,

145
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,907
-we have a responsibility--
-I told you.

146
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,778
I took care of that
glitch personally.

147
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,693
We're clean.

148
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:32,087
And right now, we have
what every company needs,

149
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,089
-momentum.
-To launch this event

150
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:37,092
without proper vetting,
is reckless.

151
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,268
We owe it to our users
to make sure it's safe.

152
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:41,444
It is safe.

153
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:45,230
So, unless you have
specific proof that it's not,

154
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,971
please do not waste
my time with this, again.

155
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:54,239
So, wait, this is
the army buddy

156
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,458
Malefic impersonated?

157
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,112
Yes, but this is
the real Pete

158
00:06:57,155 --> 00:06:59,070
and Kelly adores him.

159
00:06:59,114 --> 00:07:01,072
-You must be Alex.
-Hi.

160
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,118
Kelly couldn't stop
talking about you
when she called.

161
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,425
Oh, hey, thanks so much
for meeting with us.

162
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:07,470
Uh, Pete Andrews,
this is Kara Danvers,
my sister.

163
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,863
Hi, nice to meet you.

164
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,300
Of CatCo Worldwide Media.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

165
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:13,955
Your use of syntax
and imagery is sublime,

166
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:16,740
suggesting a much deeper
understanding of language

167
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,089
than just modern English.

168
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,743
Uh, thank you.

169
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:21,963
Did you spend a lot
of time growing up
in foreign countries?

170
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,444
Uh, no.

171
00:07:24,487 --> 00:07:25,793
We're Midvale born
and raised.

172
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:27,359
Yup. Yup.

173
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,492
Although right now, I feel
a little like Eliza Doolittle.

174
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:32,277
"The rain in Spain...

175
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:34,802
...stays, um,
mainly in the plain."

176
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:36,456
-Sorry.
-I'm sorry.

177
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,459
Occupational hazard
for a linguist.
I can't turn it off.

178
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:42,331
Kelly said that you need help
finding a unique symbol?

179
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,638
Yes. It belongs
to a very dangerous

180
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:46,117
organization that
we're tracking.

181
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:49,120
We're trying to find
any evidence of it on Earth.

182
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:52,167
Buildings, temples,
whatever can pinpoint us

183
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,864
to their current location,

184
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,345
Though we think they were
behind the solar event
yesterday.

185
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,175
-They're called Leviathan.
-Leviathan?

186
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:02,525
I've heard whispers about them,
but only as myth.

187
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,614
Well, we can assure you
they are very real,

188
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,181
and they are very dangerous.

189
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,662
I think I know
where to start.

190
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,371
Neat party trick.

191
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,982
Do you use that at your
corporate cocktail soirees?

192
00:08:25,026 --> 00:08:26,070
Don't be bitter.

193
00:08:26,114 --> 00:08:27,332
You had your chance
at the throne.

194
00:08:27,376 --> 00:08:29,857
Oh, you think
you can fare better?

195
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,643
With those idiotic ringlets
and obnoxious
porcelain cheek bones.

196
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,645
You are a bolt
of power and fear,

197
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,342
and yet you insist
on wearing this

198
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:38,692
stupid human shell.

199
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,043
You're an insult.

200
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,567
You are just jealous
because I have evolved.

201
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,529
Fitting in with the humans
has allowed me to lull them

202
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,705
into a false sense
of security.

203
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,358
You should really
consider it.

204
00:08:53,402 --> 00:08:54,882
What's in there?
Poison lipstick?

205
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,586
This was stolen from us
years ago.

206
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,023
Lex Luthor found it
just wasting away

207
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,548
in a chilly place that
you know quite well.

208
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,681
So, you came here
to gloat.

209
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,205
I came here to give you
a second chance

210
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,033
to destroy the Supers.

211
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,731
You know what this
weapon is,

212
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,428
so you know what it needs.

213
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:22,431
Get it for me.

214
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,914
And this time,
do not fail.

215
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,052
In 1752, a series
of crop circles

216
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,141
appeared in Greece,
only weeks before

217
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,753
a plague of locusts
took out the entire region.

218
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,582
But this symbol is similar,
but it's slightly off.

219
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,019
Well, symbols like languages
evolve over time.

220
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,718
But all of these

221
00:09:48,762 --> 00:09:50,590
have the same DNA.
Look at this.

222
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,070
567 A.D, Macedonia,

223
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:55,725
1134 A.D, Bavaria.

224
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,293
Each time this symbol
has appeared,

225
00:09:58,336 --> 00:09:59,816
catastrophe has followed.

226
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,601
There's gotta be a way
to use this pattern

227
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,994
to predict where
Leviathan is now.

228
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,127
Well, there's a special
collections room
in the library,

229
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,345
might have more information.

230
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,086
I'll go try to get access.

231
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,348
-Great.
-Be right back.

232
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:21,751
You know what?

233
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:22,970
I'm starting to get it.

234
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:25,842
The desire to be
in a new reality,

235
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:29,106
to live in a world that's
a little less complicated.

236
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,457
Hmm. Is this about
your run-in with Lena?

237
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,025
She was so kind
after Jeremiah died,

238
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:37,680
and then... and then she
breaks into the fortress

239
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,857
and accuses me,
me, of hypocrisy.

240
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,293
And you know what?
The more I think about it,

241
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,773
the more the pattern
makes sense.

242
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:46,471
Her and Lex are working
on something with Leviathan,

243
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,648
and it makes me
so angry,

244
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,214
I... I just...
I wanna--

245
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:51,346
Hide?

246
00:10:55,698 --> 00:10:57,178
William, what's going on?

247
00:10:57,221 --> 00:10:59,310
I've been dissecting
Margot Morrison's
manifesto video.

248
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:01,791
I think I found something
you're gonna want to see.

249
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,358
I'll be right there.

250
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:05,534
William thinks he found
something connected
to Margot.

251
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:06,666
Go. Check it out.

252
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,058
-I'll stay with Pete.
-Thank you.

253
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,016
Yeah.

254
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,978
Hey, I'm so sorry.

255
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:16,893
Kara had a work emergency.
She had to go.

256
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,809
Oh, that's all right. I think
we may have hit a wall anyway.

257
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:22,551
All of my requests
were completely denied,

258
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:23,552
which is strange,
because I've been

259
00:11:23,595 --> 00:11:25,554
in that room
many times.

260
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:28,731
I think it stopped when
I mentioned
the word Leviathan.

261
00:11:28,775 --> 00:11:30,733
Which means that
we must've struck a nerve.

262
00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:32,256
And in my experience,

263
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,910
that means that we're on
the right path.

264
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:36,565
Maybe. I mean,
they shut me down cold.

265
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:38,393
So we find a new way.

266
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:39,829
Pete, if we are right
about this,

267
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,744
this is a matter
of global security.

268
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:44,616
We cannot be concerned
about breaking the rules.

269
00:11:45,574 --> 00:11:48,055
-Now, are you with me?
-Yeah.

270
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,621
Lead the way.

271
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,854
Why are his eyes
like that?

272
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,900
The Q-waves have
a direct effect on his irises.

273
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,163
The inkiness indicates
an irregular break.

274
00:12:13,602 --> 00:12:15,560
Did Klaus hurt
the other prisoner

275
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:17,214
before his eyes turned?
Or after?

276
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:18,955
Before. Definitely before.

277
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:21,871
What if the act of violence

278
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,568
isn't a result
of Non Nocere failing?

279
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:25,222
What if the act itself
caused the failure?

280
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,441
His need to survive

281
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,399
clashed with his directive
to do no harm.

282
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,879
Klaus felt like his life
was in danger.

283
00:12:29,923 --> 00:12:32,403
His brain adapted,
it evolved
to protect himself.

284
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:34,884
But now,
his survival instincts,
they're in overdrive.

285
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:37,234
You can fix it, right?

286
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:39,889
I mean, after all
you've done for us here,

287
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:42,805
now that I'm free
from fear and anger,

288
00:12:42,849 --> 00:12:45,286
I'm finally enjoying life

289
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,331
and the community.

290
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,464
I forgot what it was like
to have friends.

291
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,690
Are you feeling okay after
what happened in the elevator?

292
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:14,141
Technology is
the greatest evil

293
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,707
mankind has ever faced.

294
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,668
See? Right there.

295
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:22,845
Oh, my God.
You're right.

296
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:25,674
Whoever that is, they're
wearing an Image Inducer.

297
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,328
But why would someone
imitate her?

298
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,634
You said she worked
at Obsidian North?

299
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,811
Let's get our hands on
Obsidian's personnel files,

300
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,247
see everyone she was
in contact with.

301
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,688
I expanded my search,
but no sign of Leviathan

302
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,299
anywhere within
a 300-mile radius.

303
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,867
Hmm. Perhaps, we can
try again later.

304
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,653
Oh, yeah. It's a little
unconventional, I know.

305
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:52,570
To go out wearing this face,
but I like it like this.

306
00:13:52,614 --> 00:13:53,963
I'm just as much
J'onn J'onzz

307
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,965
the human as I am
the Martian Manhunter.

308
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,489
The last time I saw you,

309
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:01,492
you were wrestling with
your own sense of self,

310
00:14:01,536 --> 00:14:03,233
burdened by the ghost
of your father.

311
00:14:04,191 --> 00:14:05,975
But now...

312
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:07,847
You're finally in command
of who you are.

313
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,718
And you,
the last time I saw you,

314
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,503
you were engaged in
endless Martian civil wars--

315
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:14,679
Until your brother's
heroic return to Mars,

316
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,856
which was nothing
short of a miracle.

317
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:19,554
We're finally on the path
to peace because of him.

318
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,993
Because of you.

319
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,561
Well, I guess we were both
in different places back then.

320
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,737
But I gotta say,

321
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:32,306
I'm really glad
you're here now.

322
00:14:42,577 --> 00:14:46,015
-Should we wake her, or--
-No, no, no. That's, uh...

323
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,060
That's just how
she works.

324
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:53,762
-I don't understand it.

325
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,372
Every time we try
to re-establish

326
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,374
Non Nocere in the subject,
his vitals spike

327
00:14:57,418 --> 00:14:59,202
and his body's
overriding it.

328
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:01,596
It's like he's treating
my directive
like some kind of flu virus.

329
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,206
Try again.

330
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,078
We've already
given what we can.
Any more would kill him.

331
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,515
Uh, guys.

332
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:22,791
It's spreading.

333
00:15:22,834 --> 00:15:24,619
Wait. I created
a safe environment,

334
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:26,490
free from outside predators

335
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:27,927
so that the prisoners
would be safe.

336
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,319
But when Klaus turned,

337
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,669
he became the predator,

338
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,280
triggering the survival
instincts in
the other inmate.

339
00:15:33,323 --> 00:15:35,108
So, when he attacked
the other inmate
in the elevator--

340
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:36,631
A domino effect was born.

341
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:39,503
Evolution is a bitch.

342
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:55,084
Hello?

343
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:12,319
Get out of my dreams, Brainy.

344
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,018
Get out of my dreams!

345
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:41,348
Gotcha.

346
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,178
Mmm. Mmm.

347
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,049
Seriously, what do
you put in these things?

348
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,182
I can't stop eating them.
They're so good.

349
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,271
Crack.

350
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:54,535
Just kidding. But seriously,
um, I can't tell you.

351
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,885
Chef Emile would drag me
to patisserie prison

352
00:16:56,928 --> 00:16:58,234
for even hinting at it.

353
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,543
So, I didn't find any
communication between

354
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,066
Margot and the Luthors.

355
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,154
But she did spend
a lot of time

356
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:07,896
talking to
this employee, 873.

357
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,376
No name.
Just a badge number.

358
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,206
Well, then let's find
this mysterious number 873.

359
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,338
Supergirl,
Dreamer just woke up
from a vision.

360
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:18,602
We believe Rama Khan
is at the Oregon Geological Monitoring Station.

361
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:20,430
We think he's gonna
trigger a massive earthquake.

362
00:17:23,912 --> 00:17:25,740
Uh... Oh, shoot.

363
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:28,525
-Shoot. It's my sister's cat.
-Oh.

364
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:31,224
He got out again.
I gotta go.

365
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,703
I'll come with you.

366
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:34,357
Cats love me,
for some reason.

367
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,750
Of course they do.

368
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:38,405
Uh, but this one, he gets
real skittish around...

369
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,103
around tall guys with...

370
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,540
accents and...
and he bites.

371
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,239
Well, a shy biter. He...

372
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:48,589
You call Kelly
about number 873.

373
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,590
I'll be right back.

374
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,769
It's over, Rama Khan.

375
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,083
Oh, no.
It's just begun.

376
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,392
We're in a massive
subduction zone.

377
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,133
If it ruptures, the results
will be devastating.

378
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,787
Then we should
stop that from happening.

379
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,879
Director Dox,

380
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:19,402
we have reports that
Rama Khan has triggered

381
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,230
a massive seismic event
in Portland.

382
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:23,754
Supergirl and her allies
are already there, sir.

383
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,016
Should we provide backup?

384
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:28,803
Yes.

385
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:32,154
I think I can fix this.

386
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:34,243
I can reset everything
with a burst of Q-waves.

387
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,331
We just need to reconfigure

388
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,637
the Q-wave generator
in my office.

389
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,421
It's on the other side
of the prison.

390
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:39,944
All right.
Safety in numbers.

391
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,294
I'm coming with you.

392
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:51,652
Excuse me.

393
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,308
Lena, help!

394
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:03,142
Stop, please!

395
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:07,842
Oh, are you all right?

396
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,480
We need to get the staff.

397
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:38,873
It's enhancing his powers.

398
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,189
Supergirl,
we've stopped the quake.

399
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,364
We're gonna go put
the town back together.

400
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,371
Thank you for the assistance,
we'll take it from here.

401
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:01,025
Assistance?
We found him.

402
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,201
We get to question him first.

403
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,506
Absolutely not.

404
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,726
Leviathan is the DEO's
top priority.

405
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,859
No, Brainy, the DEO
might be compromised.

406
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,339
I have reason to believe
that Lex

407
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,514
has been working
with Leviathan.

408
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,560
You turn Rama Khan
into the DEO,

409
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,302
who knows
what Lex will do.

410
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:19,522
I'm sorry.
My decision is final.

411
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:20,741
Rama Khan comes with me.

412
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:22,786
So are we.

413
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,704
The Special Collections Room
is right here.

414
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,097
Okay.

415
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,881
Well, just keep watch.
I need a minute.

416
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,579
We only have one.

417
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:33,971
It's the 5:00 p.m.
shift change.

418
00:20:34,015 --> 00:20:35,582
The new guard's gonna be
coming on duty any second.

419
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:40,587
- Run.

420
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:14,664
What's wrong?

421
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:17,319
It's just...

422
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:20,409
Something about that staff
is giving me bad vibes.

423
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,804
Hey, Brainy.

424
00:21:23,847 --> 00:21:26,154
We need to find out
if Leviathan
has anything else planned.

425
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,590
I will.

426
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:28,983
You and Dreamer can watch
from the observation room.

427
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,332
Whoa, whoa, wait.

428
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,595
You said
I could go in there
with you.

429
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,162
I said you could come
to the DEO.

430
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,122
Look, this is a very
sensitive prisoner.

431
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,776
By my calculations,
any interrogation will be

432
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,301
85% more successful
without you in the room.

433
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,606
Brainy...

434
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,304
Are you really going
to shut us out like that?

435
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,480
Did you call me when you found
Rama Khan's location?

436
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:49,395
Did you?

437
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,359
Are you sure
this is a good idea,

438
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,013
leaving Brainy alone
in there with him?

439
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:00,623
No, I don't love it,

440
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,365
but it is Brainy's DEO.

441
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,845
Brainy was in
my dream of Rama Khan.

442
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,501
What was he doing?

443
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:10,851
He was playing games
with Rama Khan.

444
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:14,507
More like, Brainy was
using Rama Khan.

445
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,688
So, it's just you
and me now, Coluan.

446
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,214
You will tell me
what I want to know.

447
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:28,695
Your fellow Leviathan,

448
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,219
your headquarters,

449
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:32,699
your endgame.

450
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,048
And why would I do that?

451
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:40,968
How is my wife?

452
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,448
She's sure somebody's
watching the house.

453
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:44,885
Oh, God. I'm so sorry for
dragging you into all this.

454
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,495
No, I jumped willingly.

455
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,367
But I think I better keep
my head down for a bit.

456
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,717
I got a friend who's gonna get
my family and me off the grid.

457
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,935
You should think
about it, too.

458
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,763
Not until we bring
all of Leviathan down.

459
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:55,722
Alex...

460
00:22:55,765 --> 00:22:57,680
For what it's worth,

461
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:00,117
you still sound like someone
who's a part of the military.

462
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:01,728
I get it.

463
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,512
Shifting to civilian life
can be hard.

464
00:23:03,556 --> 00:23:04,731
It took me months, years.

465
00:23:05,558 --> 00:23:06,733
Hell, if you ask my wife,

466
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:09,257
I still think I'm leading
a platoon of 20.

467
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,259
You get used to the
power of the uniform.

468
00:23:12,347 --> 00:23:14,131
There comes a day
when you realize...

469
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:16,482
you gotta let it go.

470
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,400
Thanks again
for helping me out.

471
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,227
I know it goes against
Andrea's orders,

472
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:25,099
and I don't want to get you
in any more trouble.

473
00:23:25,142 --> 00:23:27,406
All right, let's see
who you are,
Employee 873.

474
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:34,108
Eve Tessmacher.

475
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:36,327
Did you know her?

476
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:39,766
Oh, in another life.

477
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:41,942
And if she's still
who I think she is...

478
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:44,945
this is bad news.

479
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,655
Wait, what did he say?

480
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:01,483
That's not
a language I know,

481
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,790
or ever heard Brainy use.

482
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:12,625
Did he just say "Luthor"?

483
00:24:35,212 --> 00:24:36,170
What is it?

484
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,214
Something's wrong.

485
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,348
Rama Khan's staff.

486
00:24:40,391 --> 00:24:41,871
It's scanning the DEO
for something.

487
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:52,882
It's a trap!

488
00:24:58,018 --> 00:24:59,367
Not so fast.

489
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,200
The prisoner has escaped.

490
00:25:06,243 --> 00:25:07,636
Initiate Protocol Five.

491
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:11,031
Evacuate the DEO.

492
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,225
Enough!

493
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:40,060
And now to get
what I came for.

494
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,129
I can't find
the right frequency,
I need more time.

495
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:10,438
Back in a minute.

496
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:17,750
Gentlemen!

497
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,926
Shall we dance?

498
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,328
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

499
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,997
Steve!

500
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:53,916
Are you okay?

501
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,787
Yeah.

502
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,354
Except...

503
00:26:57,877 --> 00:26:59,008
What?

504
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:01,315
I feel like I used to feel.

505
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:02,795
The peace.

506
00:27:04,361 --> 00:27:05,798
It's all gone.

507
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:00,548
Rama Khan! Over here.

508
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,071
M'gann! No!

509
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:53,470
Is everyone safe?

510
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:56,038
Everyone's fine.

511
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,387
But Rama Khan's gone.

512
00:28:57,431 --> 00:28:59,041
We need to find him.

513
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,434
J'onn and M'gann are
out looking for him.

514
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:01,914
He could be
anywhere by now.

515
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,785
Well, then we'll
look everywhere.

516
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,049
We'll start at the Tower.

517
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,747
See if we can trace
his seismic signature.

518
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,622
-I'm needed here,
but I--
-Don't.

519
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,406
-Nia.
-No!

520
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,886
When you took off
your inhibitors,

521
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,106
I swore to be there for you
no matter what.

522
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,415
But, maybe I was wrong.

523
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:27,896
Because I don't know
who this Brainy is.

524
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,419
But, I know
I don't like him.

525
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,552
And I definitely don't
trust him.

526
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:35,034
Look...

527
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:37,297
I can't explain.

528
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,733
No more riddles.

529
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,692
What the hell were you doing
in there with Rama Khan?

530
00:29:43,477 --> 00:29:44,739
What was that language?

531
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,307
And what did Lex Luthor
have to do with it?

532
00:29:50,136 --> 00:29:51,180
Tell me.

533
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,794
Right here, right now.

534
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,845
I can't.

535
00:30:08,328 --> 00:30:10,025
You can't play the game
from both sides, Brainy.

536
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:14,813
You can't pretend to be
on our side one minute

537
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:16,249
and then push us away
the next.

538
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:21,732
If you can't pick a side,
I'll choose one for you.

539
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:30,176
And this is who?

540
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:33,657
She apparently
has a list of names
and identities...

541
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:35,181
Her real name
is Eve Tessmacher

542
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,879
and she's a very
dangerous individual.

543
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,402
Well, it says here,
we hired her

544
00:30:39,446 --> 00:30:42,014
on direct, personal
recommendation of
Gemma Cooper,

545
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,842
our board chair
and my friend.

546
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,018
No criminal record,

547
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:47,758
no black marks
on her file,

548
00:30:48,934 --> 00:30:51,327
practically
a model citizen.

549
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:54,678
I don't know
what kind of game
you two are playing,

550
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:57,899
coming to me with these
concerns based on nothing.

551
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:00,423
But I've worked too hard
to get this company
to where it is

552
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,251
to lose momentum now.

553
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:04,427
If you can't find it in you
to get fully behind

554
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:07,343
Obsidian Worldwide's
Unity Festival,

555
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:11,043
then perhaps,
you should consider
finding the door.

556
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,448
Peace at last.

557
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,712
It took a bit of persuading,
but the prisoners have been
pacified and neutralized.

558
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:29,931
They're ready for
the next round.

559
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:36,068
Non Nocere is dead.

560
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,202
It doesn't work.

561
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,943
It can't.
It never could.

562
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:47,427
Pain is a necessary part
of being human, of life.

563
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,732
And I was delusional
to think

564
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:50,647
that I could save people,
or fix it.

565
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:55,914
Humanity will always try
to protect itself, to evolve.

566
00:31:55,957 --> 00:31:57,480
You can't stop that.

567
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,440
You saw Steve,
how helpless he was,
all because of me.

568
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,486
I was rooting for you, Lena.

569
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:04,966
But,

570
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:06,968
I have to agree.

571
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,450
Humanity can't be fixed.

572
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:14,933
They need to be controlled.

573
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:19,676
Leviathan may be
our biggest threat,

574
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,330
but they were right
about one thing.

575
00:32:22,462 --> 00:32:25,987
Humanity needs a firm hand
to guide it.

576
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,468
To lead it.

577
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:32,472
And not some
arrogant alien.

578
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,170
It needs to be human.

579
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:40,828
You mean, a Luthor.

580
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:45,267
Think of all that we could
accomplish together,

581
00:32:45,311 --> 00:32:49,315
if we just take our rightful
place as humanity's saviors.

582
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:52,666
Saviors?

583
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:57,323
Of course.

584
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,369
You never change.

585
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:04,983
This was always

586
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,332
all about you,

587
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,812
your megalomania.

588
00:33:08,856 --> 00:33:12,033
You... knew my plan
wouldn't work,

589
00:33:12,077 --> 00:33:13,295
that it was doomed.

590
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:14,296
You were counting on it.

591
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,994
How dare you?

592
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:18,474
I gave you the world.

593
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,649
Everything.

594
00:33:19,693 --> 00:33:21,173
I supported you.

595
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:22,870
I sabotaged nothing,

596
00:33:22,913 --> 00:33:24,524
touched nothing.

597
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,744
I set aside my own goals
for you.

598
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:31,313
Because you needed to see
your little project fail

599
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,576
with your own eyes.

600
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,492
To know the true depravity
of humanity.

601
00:33:36,536 --> 00:33:39,800
To know that my way
was the only way.

602
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:52,987
You're a monster.

603
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:59,646
But that doesn't mean
I have to be one, too.

604
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,918
We've lost the DEO,
we've lost Brainy.

605
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:13,573
Leviathan has Kryptonite.

606
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:16,271
Without Lena to build
me a Kryptonite suit,

607
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:18,534
I have nothing.

608
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:19,753
We still have each other.

609
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:21,581
And we will stop them.

610
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,713
Go home.

611
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,280
We'll deal with this
in the morning.

612
00:34:33,854 --> 00:34:34,811
M'gann.

613
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,080
I can't find Rama Khan's
energy signal.

614
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:44,386
I've lost his trail.

615
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,605
Listen, listen, listen.

616
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,782
I nearly lost you
out there today.

617
00:34:50,479 --> 00:34:52,090
-I'm just not sure I can--

618
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:56,094
J'onn.

619
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,444
It's okay.

620
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,638
- Hey.
-Hi.

621
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,162
How did it go with Pete?

622
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:24,600
Oh.

623
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:25,993
Not so good.

624
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:29,039
Um, we were ambushed
by Leviathan.

625
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,171
Wait, what?

626
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:31,172
Pete's okay.

627
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:33,653
It's fine. I just...

628
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:35,785
Look, I made a mistake.

629
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:41,139
I just...
I pressed and I put him
in danger.

630
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:44,446
I just...

631
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,189
I'm not used to
being so exposed.

632
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:52,280
And now with the DEO,
it's gone...

633
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:53,238
I'm so sorry.

634
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:59,200
Oh, and speaking
of exposed,

635
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:02,160
William and I discovered
that Eve Tessmacher

636
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:03,900
has been working
for Obsidian.

637
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,989
Have you talked
to Andrea?

638
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,165
She didn't care.

639
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,992
In this world
there is no record

640
00:36:09,036 --> 00:36:11,212
of Eve being anything
but perfect.

641
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:15,521
She threatened to fire me
if I came to her again.

642
00:36:15,564 --> 00:36:17,305
-Come on.
-Yeah.

643
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:20,178
So, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna leave Obsidian?

644
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:21,962
No.

645
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:24,094
No. That'll make it
much harder
to get to the bottom of this.

646
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,313
I just...

647
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,968
I've got to get better
at hiding.

648
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,059
Maybe you should, too.

649
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,106
What do you mean,
like, wear a mask?

650
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,544
It worked for my brother.

651
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:42,722
If you're going to be
a vigilante,

652
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,377
you might as well
go all the way.

653
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:51,774
Mr. Luthor?

654
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:52,949
We got the prisoners
back in their cells.

655
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:54,081
What do you want us
to do with them?

656
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:05,614
Burn it.

657
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,585
Just the person I was
hoping to hear from.

658
00:37:19,628 --> 00:37:20,760
Did you get my gift?

659
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:21,891
Oh, yes.

660
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:23,589
I am very grateful.

661
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,547
How grateful?

662
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:28,158
Regarding your request
to meet my colleagues,

663
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,248
I'll send you a car
tomorrow morning.

664
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,206
Well, now I'm grateful.

665
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,208
See you tomorrow.

666
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,742
Eventful day, Director Dox?

667
00:37:46,786 --> 00:37:50,485
I know. I disobeyed
your direct order.

668
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:53,314
I interfered with Leviathan
and the Supers.

669
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,838
I am responsible.

670
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,451
For everything.

671
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:08,329
Oh, Dox.

672
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:10,200
Of course, I knew that
you'd rush in

673
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:11,811
to help your little friends.

674
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:14,117
You're all gooey hero
on the inside.

675
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:15,684
I don't have to be a genius
to know that.

676
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,469
But don't worry.

677
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:18,818
Everything is right on track.

678
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:21,037
Even the loss of the DEO
is a tax write-off.

679
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,824
You wanted Rama Khan
to be brought here.

680
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:27,783
To get the Kryptonite.

681
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,829
I gave Leviathan
a little trinket

682
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:32,135
from the Fortress that,
with Kryptonite,

683
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:33,702
will make Supergirl's life
miserable.

684
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,009
And they were
very appreciative.

685
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,230
You got an invite
to the ship.

686
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:42,058
I told you,

687
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,539
trust the process,

688
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,671
save the world.

689
00:38:46,498 --> 00:38:47,325
Get some sleep.

690
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,891
Big day tomorrow.

691
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,094
I have made
a terrible mistake.

692
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:04,663
I was hurt.

693
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,102
I was so hurt. And...

694
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,497
I thought I could
get rid of the hurt.

695
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,717
I thought that
I knew better,

696
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,240
that I could make
the world
a better place.

697
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,328
But I was wrong.

698
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:22,637
That hurt, um,

699
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,120
took me down
a dark, dark path,

700
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,558
where I was

701
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,299
blind to what I was
really doing,

702
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,432
to what I'd become.

703
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,568
You were right.

704
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:43,615
This whole time
I became a villain,
and then...

705
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:47,923
I'm not looking
for forgiveness.

706
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:50,796
I know what I said
and I know what I did,
but I am...

707
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:59,326
I am really hoping that you
will believe me right now.
Okay?

708
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,330
Lex is working
with Leviathan,

709
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:05,288
and they are going
to use Obsidian

710
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:06,638
to do something terrible...

711
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:09,641
using the system,

712
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,905
that I made
with my project.

713
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,823
I didn't know I was
helping them, but I did.
And...

714
00:41:18,824 --> 00:41:21,217
now I want to help
stop them, so...

715
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,092
Please, okay?

716
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:31,924
I want to help stop
Lex and Leviathan.

717
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:46,504
Sit down.
