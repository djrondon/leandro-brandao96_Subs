1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:03,003
Previously onSupergirl...

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:04,613
This Earth-Bender
has been spotted

3
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:06,223
at the scene of the crime
throughout history.

4
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:08,182
Pompeii, even as far back
as Noah's flood.

5
00:00:08,225 --> 00:00:09,922
He literally manipulates
the Earth.

6
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:13,665
You won't survive me again,
Kryptonian.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,583
No! No, Russ!
Please, somebody help!

8
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:22,326
I beg your forgiveness
by submitting myself
to the bond.

9
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,335
With his dying breath,
he told me
that you were Supergirl.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,121
You reassured me, ad nauseam,
you would never lie to me.

11
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:37,733
And all the while,
there wasn't a single honest
moment in our friendship.

12
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,952
Please, don't leave
the fortress
with Myriad.

13
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:42,999
Please don't let my mistake
push you to do
something terrible.

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,132
Intruder!

15
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,307
- I'm not a villain.

16
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,352
You shouldn't have
treated me like one.

17
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,882
Kara.

18
00:00:56,926 --> 00:01:00,060
It's the Fortress's defenses.
Someone's turned them
against Supergirl.

19
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:04,412
We couldn't reach you on comms.

20
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:05,804
What happened?
Are you all right?

21
00:01:05,848 --> 00:01:07,502
I traced Rama Khan's
energy trail here.

22
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:09,634
-I have to find Lena.
-What did Rama Khan do?

23
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:12,028
It wasn't him.
It was Lena. She knew.

24
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,160
She knew what?

25
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:15,205
My identity.
She's known for months.

26
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,340
Lex told her,
and she hates me for it.

27
00:01:21,907 --> 00:01:23,170
Lena's in Mount Norquay.

28
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:25,607
Mount Norquay is one
of Lex's old hideouts.

29
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:29,393
-Where are you going?
-To fix this.

30
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:33,615
Get Myriad online
and operational.

31
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,183
Non Nocere launches
within the hour.

32
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:40,970
And, Hope, excellent work
preparing the move.

33
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:46,106
Our Q-wave generator
is ready to integrate
with Myriad.

34
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,197
Supergirl?

35
00:01:52,677 --> 00:01:55,332
Don't worry.
The bunker's lead-lined.
She can't find us.

36
00:01:55,376 --> 00:01:57,291
These are Lex's
countermeasures.

37
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,515
What do we do?

38
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,430
Ms. Luthor?

39
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:08,737
Deploy.

40
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:15,613
That should keep her at bay.

41
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,877
- What's happening now?

42
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,749
It appears to be re-arming
the cannons with Kryptonite.

43
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:22,707
-Cancel it.
-It's on an automatic override.

44
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,709
-Shut it down.
-It's not responding.

45
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,102
Shut it down now!

46
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:31,803
Lena, don't do this.

47
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,209
We must stay true
to our mission.

48
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:50,213
We don't kill people...
no matter how much
they've hurt us.

49
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,003
I'm not gonna give up on you.

50
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:16,108
What happened?

51
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,110
How did Supergirl and Luther
beat you again?

52
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,112
It doesn't matter how.

53
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,289
I just need to explain to her.

54
00:03:22,332 --> 00:03:23,551
I wouldn't do that.

55
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:28,425
They're whispering about you.

56
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:30,384
That you've lost your edge.

57
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,516
Earthquakes
with no death counts,

58
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,953
floods with the ferocity
of a leaky faucet.

59
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:39,219
They're saying that the Elder
may put Tezumak in charge.

60
00:03:39,697 --> 00:03:40,872
Tezumak?

61
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:45,355
His tactic of war
is without limits.

62
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,662
He could accidentally
burn down the earth.

63
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:48,967
I agree.

64
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:51,492
I have been in charge
for two million years.

65
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,407
And you've been losing lately,

66
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,452
and he'll hold that
against you.

67
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:56,932
Tezumak is a snake.

68
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:58,760
Oh, and let me guess.
Next is your advice

69
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:02,416
about how your way
is so much more efficient.

70
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,375
Tezumak isn't the only
manipulator around here.

71
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:08,335
Look, what I said
yesterday was unfair.

72
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:11,338
Yes, I believe
my technology would work.

73
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,862
But I agree.

74
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:17,169
Your way is more efficient.

75
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:19,389
This isn't about ego,
Rama Khan.

76
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,610
It's about saving the earth.

77
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:26,353
The world is
at a tipping point.
There's no turning back.

78
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:31,096
The humans
will destroy this planet
unless we destroy them first.

79
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,184
But how?

80
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:35,362
The Kryptonian won't stop.

81
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,494
She will die
to protect these humans.

82
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,583
Then let Supergirl die trying.

83
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,586
The planets are coming
into alignment

84
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,286
for the first time
in nearly 2,000 years.

85
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:47,939
But only for tonight.

86
00:04:47,983 --> 00:04:51,552
The last time this happened,
I wiped out Pompeii.

87
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:53,641
A masterpiece worth repeating.

88
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,687
If a little on the blunt side.

89
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:01,779
Not even Supergirl
can stop a massive volcano.

90
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:04,608
The Staff of the Shadow World

91
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,306
is worthless
without the Medallion.

92
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:10,484
You need the Medallion's power,
not the Medallion itself.

93
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,312
And you know
where that power is.

94
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:15,184
Acrata.

95
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,884
Supergirl.
Hey, did you find Lena?

96
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,495
What was she doing
in Lex's bunker?

97
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,975
Brainy, can you get some line
of communication to a bunker

98
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,021
three miles below
the Norquay mountain range?

99
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,936
Yes, but depending
on the processing power--

100
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,461
Okay, stop.
Just tell me right now,

101
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:33,550
when did Lex tell Lena
your identity?

102
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:35,160
And why was she attacking you
in the Fortress?

103
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:37,554
-What the hell is going on?
-It was after Shelley Island.

104
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:39,948
-But Lex died there.
-No, he didn't.

105
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:45,910
He portaled somehow
to a safe house
where Lena shot him.

106
00:05:45,954 --> 00:05:49,436
She killed him to protect me,
to protect all of us.

107
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,525
But before he died,
he told her.

108
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,614
She's been lying to us
for months.

109
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:56,921
Okay, so why attack you now?

110
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,359
So she could steal Myriad
from the Fortress.

111
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:03,580
Lena stole Myriad?

112
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,930
It's how I tracked her
to Norquay,

113
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:08,498
but I don't think
this is what it looks like.

114
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,501
She saved me from Rama Khan
in the Fortress.

115
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,634
And even at Lex's bunker,

116
00:06:13,677 --> 00:06:17,507
the cannons were loaded
with Kryptonite,
but she didn't use them.

117
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:18,987
I can still fix this.

118
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,903
I can get through to her,
if I could just talk to her.

119
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,557
Brainy, can you
get me in there?

120
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,428
We could harness the Kryptonian
cache crystals we have here

121
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:27,691
to covertly project
a hologram beam
into her bunker.

122
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,606
-Great.
-Okay, if not for mind control

123
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,435
over the population,
then why would
Lena need Myriad?

124
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,611
-I think I might know.

125
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,355
Malefic.

126
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,842
Engage Psychic Inhibitors.

127
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,192
-Alex, please.
-Agent Dox,
apprehend the suspect.

128
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,673
Alex, please!
Malefic and I mind-melded.

129
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:56,198
I know his true intentions.
He is here to help.

130
00:06:56,241 --> 00:06:57,678
He has some information...

131
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,202
about Lena.

132
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,770
I was her prisoner.

133
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,691
Okay, first, how did you escape
the Phantom Zone?

134
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:13,607
I didn't escape.
I was never there.

135
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,479
When the Phantom Zone Projector
hit me at the planetarium,

136
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,307
I went directly
to Ms. Luthor's lab.

137
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,658
Lena was the one
who helped Brainy
fix the Phantom Zone Projector.

138
00:07:21,702 --> 00:07:22,964
She must have changed
the end coordinates.

139
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:24,618
But what did she need you for?

140
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:26,141
Mind control.

141
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:29,405
She was experimenting
with my ability to incept.

142
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,103
If Lena can harness
Malefic's Q-waves
and merge them with the power

143
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:35,063
of Myriad's distribution,
the results
would be unprecedented.

144
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:37,674
World-wide total control
in an instant.

145
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,937
But we don't know
her intentions.

146
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:42,462
She's trying to make
people less violent.

147
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:46,509
You use Myriad to impose
your will on the world
population, not save it.

148
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:48,076
She's hurting.

149
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:49,730
All she's experienced
are people hurting each other,

150
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,427
the same way I did.

151
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,256
-Clearly, she thinks
she's doing good.
- It's true.

152
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:59,304
I had long planned
to destroy my brother,

153
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:02,351
but Ms. Luthor said
it went against her morality
and stopped me.

154
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:06,747
Alex, she's not hurting anyone.
Not even Malefic, her prisoner.

155
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,922
I can still save her.

156
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:11,012
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do.

157
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,667
I'm the one who hurt her,
so I'm going to fix this.

158
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,625
Brainy, get the
hologram online.

159
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,509
-Acrata.

160
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:34,731
-I have a job for you.
-And I have one for you.

161
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:39,170
You can tell them to stop
sending agents like you
with jobs for me.

162
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:43,523
After everything
Leviathan has done to me,
taken from me...

163
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,438
you can tell them that I quit.

164
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,103
-What are you?
-What am I?

165
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:02,237
I am Rama Khan,
guardian of this Earth,

166
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,108
the one who endowed you
with your powers.

167
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,157
I understand the pain of loss.

168
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:14,292
Obey me and I will
offer you a way out.

169
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,040
Tell me what you want.

170
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:26,391
One last job,
then you will be released.

171
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,829
And my father?

172
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:30,874
Your father
can keep his riches.

173
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:33,921
For what little they're worth.

174
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:45,236
Hologram online
and ready to commence.

175
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:47,064
Good luck.

176
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:55,116
-It's almost ready, Ms. Luthor.
-We are so close, Hope.

177
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,510
I'll finish
consolidating the data.

178
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,729
We can save them.

179
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,905
All of them.

180
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,607
Lena.

181
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:11,611
Supergirl.

182
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,701
-Please, just hear me out.
-Save your breath.

183
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:17,660
You showed me
who you really are,
and I believe you.

184
00:10:17,704 --> 00:10:21,055
You have every right
to say that,
but don't do this.

185
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,057
Do what?

186
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,886
Whatever it is you're planning
on doing with Myriad
and Malefic's Q-waves.

187
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,322
Did it ever occur to you

188
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:29,106
that I was gonna do something
good for the world?

189
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,500
With Myriad,
people won't understand.

190
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:34,285
Of course,
you assumed the worst.
I'm not the bad guy.

191
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:38,072
I know. You spent years
trying to be open and trusting,

192
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:40,814
even when everyone expected you
to be like your family.

193
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:44,861
Even when everyone in your life
let you down.

194
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:48,909
Even when I was weak
and lied to you,

195
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:53,696
knowing that all you
ever asked for was the truth,

196
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,741
you were always better.

197
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:57,744
Lex took advantage
of my weakness

198
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,833
and he used it
to manipulate you.

199
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:02,792
He wanted my mistakes
to change you.

200
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:06,622
He wanted you to become him.

201
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,972
But you are nothing like him.

202
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
Nothing.

203
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:15,152
Don't let my mistakes turn you
into something you're not.

204
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:18,765
I am good.

205
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,506
And I always was.

206
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,292
Lex didn't change me
and you didn't
change me either.

207
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:27,382
You just exposed me
to the ugliness of humanity.

208
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,863
You did me a favor, Kara.

209
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,517
I learned what kind of
deceitful person
you really are,

210
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:34,868
and that's what
inspired me to do this.

211
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:38,306
-Lena--
-Your words mean
nothing to me anymore.

212
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,352
Spare us both the drama.
Leave me alone.

213
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:42,832
Wait.

214
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:50,666
Hey.

215
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:53,800
You okay?

216
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:56,193
No.

217
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,807
I couldn't get through to her.

218
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,549
Sorry.

219
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:09,554
You know, a part of me
always knew that this
couldn't be that easy.

220
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:15,386
And I get it.
I fully understand
why she feels betrayed.

221
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,520
It's so hard for her
to trust people.

222
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,871
But I made her trust me.

223
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,309
Over and over again,
I made her believe

224
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:28,965
that I was the best friend
who would never ever hurt her.

225
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,927
And then she finds out
in the most horrible way

226
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,061
that our entire friendship
was based on lies.

227
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,760
Look, you were damned
either way, Kara.

228
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,026
Your choice to
conceal your identity,

229
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:49,943
it wasn't born out of a place
of maliciousness.

230
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:52,946
It was born out of love
and compassion.

231
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,296
And you were just trying
to protect your family.

232
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,993
And you were
trying to protect Lena

233
00:12:57,037 --> 00:13:00,562
from people who could use
that information to hurt us.

234
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:04,827
And look, I love Lena, too.

235
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,612
I am deeply upset
by what is going on.

236
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,485
But this...

237
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:13,140
This isn't just two friends
that are in a fight.

238
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:16,056
This is someone
who has turned a corner.

239
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,798
No, but this is not her.
This is not our Lena.

240
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,626
Well, who is our Lena?
I mean...

241
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,109
She knew that Lex
was out of prison,
and she said nothing.

242
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:30,200
She kept Sam Arias locked
in a subbasement at L-Corp,

243
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:34,161
knowing that she was Reign,
and she said nothing.

244
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:38,034
She knows
how to make Kryptonite,

245
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,036
and she kept that
hidden from us.

246
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,865
Lena is leading her
own double-life.

247
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,345
You are making her sound
like a Luthor.

248
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,390
Maybe that's because
she is one.

249
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,525
We can't put our faith
in some distant hope

250
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,354
that she's gonna
do the right thing...

251
00:13:53,397 --> 00:13:56,313
...when every single action

252
00:13:56,357 --> 00:13:59,926
that she has taken up until now
points to the contrary.

253
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,971
Okay, we have
to stop her, Kara.

254
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:04,408
The safety of the world
depends on that.

255
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:07,977
She is not Lex.
I will not treat her
like a villain.

256
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:10,980
I know you won't.
That's why I have to.

257
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:14,331
What are you talking about?

258
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:17,639
When you went to speak to her,
we used the hologram

259
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:20,337
to piggyback a virus
into the bunker's mainframe.

260
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,167
Alex, you used me?

261
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,822
In a few moments,
Lena's defenses will be down

262
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,780
and Myriad will be stalled.

263
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,392
By then, if we have to take
more drastic actions,

264
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,916
Claymore 3 is positioned
above Mount Norquay.

265
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,093
-What? Oh.
-And I will give her time
to surrender.

266
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:41,184
Kara, we have to
start thinking with our heads,

267
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,360
not with our hearts.

268
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,411
It's ready, Ms. Luthor.

269
00:14:57,461 --> 00:15:01,161
Supergirl caused you
a great deal of pain.
I can see it in your eyes.

270
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,945
After my family
and after Andrea,

271
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:04,947
I knew better than to trust
in friendship anymore.

272
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:08,603
All of the anguish that
you're going through,
it doesn't seem worth it.

273
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:12,128
It inspired Non Nocere.
It inspired you.

274
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,569
Who needs friends
when you can save the world?

275
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:23,183
Myriad is ready to launch.

276
00:15:23,226 --> 00:15:27,274
Ms. Luthor,
this is your moment.
Shall I activate?

277
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:34,324
-Three, two...
-One.

278
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,809
-What's happening?
-It won't lock
onto the satellite.

279
00:15:40,852 --> 00:15:44,073
Something's interfering with
the dishes' ability to move.

280
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:48,643
It's a virus. It's working
through our mainframe.

281
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,994
-Ms. Luthor, the hologram.
-It was a Trojan horse.
Of course.

282
00:15:52,038 --> 00:15:54,736
How could I be so naive
to think that Supergirl
wanted to talk?

283
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,173
If the virus spreads, the DEO
will be able to deactivate

284
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:59,610
our security defenses
in 20 minutes.

285
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:01,569
We need a workaround
before then.

286
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,658
We could manually
unlock the arrays.

287
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:05,616
No, Lex has booby-trapped
this entire place.

288
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,750
There'll be a lethal failsafe
if I try to tamper
with the dishes.

289
00:16:08,793 --> 00:16:09,881
Then I'll go.

290
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:11,840
No, you can't.

291
00:16:13,146 --> 00:16:14,712
You're too great an asset.

292
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:17,106
Ms. Luthor, one of my
prime directives,
as you programmed,

293
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,458
was to ensure the
success of Non Nocere.
If that means self-sacrifice--

294
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,808
No. Even if you could
manually reset it,

295
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,507
there's no telling the extent
of the virus's damage.

296
00:16:27,377 --> 00:16:28,988
All right, we may need you.

297
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:31,773
It'd be short-sighted
to lose you now.

298
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:35,124
If we could
replicate the virus,

299
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:36,473
we could reverse-engineer it

300
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,214
and override the
shutoff remotely, okay?

301
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:39,999
I'll need some help.

302
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:43,611
Very well.

303
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,092
Accessing files.

304
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:49,834
J'onn, you don't
need to stay here.

305
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,140
I deserve to be locked up.

306
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,837
We both shoulder the blame

307
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:55,057
for the transgressions
of our past, Malefic,

308
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:58,539
but together,
we will move beyond them.

309
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:00,497
-J'onn, J'onn.
-What's up?

310
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:05,111
Alex, she thinks Lena
is past the point of no return.

311
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,809
She's got Claymore 3
pointed directly at the bunker.

312
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:11,900
But you can talk to her, right?
Show her that she's wrong?

313
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:15,208
You know people can change.
Look at you and Malefic.

314
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,560
I can still save Lena.
I just need more time.

315
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,258
I was in Alex's position
back on Mars

316
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:24,913
when I banished Malefic
to the Phantom Zone.

317
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:28,612
I did so because I thought
I was protecting my people.

318
00:17:28,656 --> 00:17:32,355
But I banished him
because I was afraid,
because there was no other way.

319
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,618
Right, and look
at the two of you now.

320
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:37,491
The only reason Malefic and I
were able to
come through the other side

321
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,536
is because
we can see each other's pain.

322
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,408
You've already talked to Lena.

323
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:45,716
I'm not saying Alex is right,
but what other option
does she have?

324
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,284
No. There has got
to be another way to stop Lena

325
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,330
that isn't blowing her up
in a bunker.

326
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:53,768
Malefic.

327
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:59,861
Malefic, you said Lena was
analyzing your Q-waves, right?

328
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,602
Yes.

329
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:05,345
She isolated a frequency
which allowed her
to replicate my ability.

330
00:18:05,388 --> 00:18:07,173
Maybe you're the key.

331
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,392
If we could harness
your Q-waves--

332
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:12,221
We could use them
to counteract Lena's.

333
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,615
But she's launching
a worldwide attack.

334
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:18,097
The amount of energy
Malefic would need
to counteract hers...

335
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,228
It could kill him.

336
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,969
It's worth the risk.

337
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:23,319
No, I am not trading
one life for another.

338
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,278
Please.

339
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:28,977
If I can stop Ms. Luthor
from making the same
mistakes that I did,

340
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,111
then all of the turmoil
and pain that I've caused

341
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,677
will be worth something.

342
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:35,897
Let me help.

343
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:38,247
Let me make amends.

344
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,870
Who's the target?

345
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:56,047
You're looking at it.

346
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:00,748
A supervolcano?

347
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:04,621
No. You can't be serious.
You'd be killing all of them.

348
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:14,892
Extinction level events
have been happening
since the beginning of time.

349
00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:18,679
I should know.
I was here to make them happen.

350
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:22,422
What have these people
done to deserve this?

351
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:28,645
Existence is their sin.

352
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,307
Don't think of this as the end.

353
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:41,441
Think of this as giving
the world a second chance.

354
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:46,185
For years I've worked for you,
telling myself
there was a just cause.

355
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,274
No more.

356
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,668
Maybe I can't beat you...

357
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,541
but you don't think
Supergirl will?

358
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:59,546
Supergirl is not a god. I am!

359
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:13,342
-What's going on?
-There's been
a perimeter breach.

360
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,475
-Do we have a location?
-Negative.

361
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:20,349
Help! Rama Khan is coming.
He's gonna destroy the--

362
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,187
You fool.

363
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,146
I'm saving this planet.

364
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:44,373
Now I will remake the earth,
as I should have done
a long time ago.

365
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:49,683
It's a pity you won't be here
to see it.

366
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,786
But Leviathan thanks you
for your service.

367
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,270
Brainy, I need a status update.

368
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,446
Eleven minutes until the
bunker's defenses are down.

369
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:15,143
-Alex, about the bunker--
-And Rama Khan?

370
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,319
I've analyzed security footage
of the appearance of the Shadow

371
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:18,625
and of the object
she was carrying.

372
00:21:18,668 --> 00:21:21,367
It's called "The Staff
of the Shadow World."

373
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,934
It is an artifact associated
with ancient Mesopotamians,

374
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,936
but can also be found
in Herculaneum.

375
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,417
I juxtaposed our image
with historical images
of Rama Khan and voila.

376
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:31,464
The two were last seen
in the ancient city-state
of Pompeii.

377
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:33,422
-That's concerning.
-Indeed.

378
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,816
Especially as it seems
the energy given off
by the Staff

379
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,340
can be found in one other place
in National City.

380
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,125
The building where we assumed
Leviathan was hiding.

381
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,736
That's across the street
from the Tar Pits.

382
00:21:42,779 --> 00:21:44,955
Also the site of
a dormant supervolcano.

383
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,175
The last eruption
was in the early Cenozoic Era,

384
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:50,396
and was 10,000 times
more powerful than Pompeii.

385
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,832
Rama Khan's an Earth-Bender.

386
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,444
So he's trying to recreate
Pompeii in National City.

387
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:56,837
Pompeii times 10,000.

388
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,361
Okay. We need to divide
and conquer.

389
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:01,581
Supergirl, J'onn, I want you
to get to the Tar Pits,

390
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:03,060
find Rama Khan and stop him.

391
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:05,454
You said the Sonic Cannon
defeated him the last time,

392
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:06,847
so go to the Fortress
and get that.

393
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,631
-Brainy, I need an update on--
-Alex, wait.

394
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:11,678
I have to tell you something.
You don't have to use Claymore.

395
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:15,290
We think we can use
Malefic's Q-waves
to counteract Lena's,

396
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,552
stop her using Myriad.

397
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,293
Theoretically, he is correct.

398
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,862
Okay, you want me
to use a known threat
to stop an imminent one?

399
00:22:21,905 --> 00:22:25,387
Handing over a global
Q-wave projector
to a terrorist?

400
00:22:25,431 --> 00:22:28,608
What if Malefic just decides
to change his mind
once we free him?

401
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:31,393
-He's changed.
-But you don't know
that for sure.

402
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:36,050
And between Lena and Rama Khan
gearing up for Pompeii 2.0,

403
00:22:36,093 --> 00:22:38,444
the last thing that I need
is a third catastrophe.

404
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,881
We are running out of time.
You need to go.

405
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,449
Alex, please. I know you think
what you're doing is right,

406
00:22:43,492 --> 00:22:45,538
but she is our friend.

407
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:49,411
If you use Claymore, there's no
turning back from that.

408
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:59,378
I'll get the Cannon.
I'll meet you at the Tar Pits.

409
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:07,560
She doesn't understand
how hard this is for me.

410
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,562
I mean, Lena is my friend, too,

411
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:11,172
and now all of a sudden,
I'm supposed to decide

412
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:14,436
whether I should risk
everybody's lives
just to save hers?

413
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,483
And Malefic,
he invaded my mind.

414
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:21,530
He threatened Kelly,
and now I'm just
supposed to trust him?

415
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:22,923
You know what's on the line.

416
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,577
You're the one who taught me
how to do this job,

417
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,449
and you're the one
who's had to make
really tough decisions

418
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:28,711
so that people don't die.

419
00:23:28,755 --> 00:23:30,757
You have every reason
to fear my brother.

420
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,890
I can't promise you
that Malefic
has changed for good.

421
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:38,721
People make mistakes
and they do terrible things.

422
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:43,465
We have to let them do better,

423
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,162
bring them back into the light.

424
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:46,729
Otherwise...

425
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:49,993
what's the point
in trying to save everyone?

426
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:57,697
The DEO
has sent another warning.

427
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,613
In nine minutes,
our defenses will be disabled.

428
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,266
-Do you want me to--
-Delete it.

429
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,793
What was that?

430
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:09,317
That felt like
a residual aftershock.

431
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,930
Yes. A 5.4-magnitude earthquake
right in the heart
of National City.

432
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:16,324
It's knocked the entire
satellite array offline.

433
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,805
There's no way I can
reverse-engineer anything now.

434
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,634
I can still try
a manual override.

435
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,549
I can reposition
the dishes myself.

436
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,202
We discussed this.
Absolutely not.

437
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,596
You could be killed. Both
Hope and Eve gone, forever.

438
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,121
But it would be worth it
for both of us
because I believe in you.

439
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:32,775
Eve did, too.

440
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:34,864
I have seen
the depravity of humans.

441
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,867
I have seen
the betrayal and the pain.

442
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:39,826
Let me help,
so that we can stop them

443
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:42,219
from committing any more
of these horrible acts
once and for all.

444
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:45,484
No. I will not allow it.
We will find another way.

445
00:24:46,746 --> 00:24:49,270
Your partnership has meant
the world to me, Hope.

446
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,578
You're the only friend
I can count on.

447
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:55,624
But, Ms. Luthor,
I'm not your friend.

448
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:58,366
I'm something you created
to serve a purpose.

449
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:02,979
You're right.

450
00:25:05,547 --> 00:25:06,940
This is the only way.

451
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,518
Anything on your psychic scan?

452
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:21,824
Nothing.

453
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,348
Could Brainy have been wrong?

454
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:30,920
Apparently not.

455
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,686
He's using something more
than earth-bending powers.

456
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,035
You're right.

457
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,739
I see the Shadow and the Staff
in an underground chamber.

458
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:08,567
-It looks like she's stuck.
-I've got her.

459
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:18,185
Has Lena responded
to any of our warnings?

460
00:26:18,228 --> 00:26:20,927
None so far. She appears
to be deleting them.

461
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,669
Her auto defenses will be
disabled in five minutes.

462
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:29,109
If Claymore is launched,
what are our odds?

463
00:26:29,152 --> 00:26:31,851
98% chance Myriad
will be neutralized

464
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,244
and a .01% chance
Lena will surrender,

465
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,725
which makes it
a virtual certainty
Lena will not survive.

466
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,641
-And if we use Malefic?
-Our odds shift slightly.

467
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:45,821
86% chance we will stop Myriad
and a 0% chance
Lena will be harmed.

468
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,781
Lock Claymore in position,
and prep Malefic.

469
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:52,306
But, Brainy, you let him know
that if he so much as smiles,

470
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:55,657
I will have a dozen agents
and their guns
pointed directly at his heart.

471
00:27:00,923 --> 00:27:02,838
It's useless.

472
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:07,234
The Staff holds me
and it needs me.

473
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,802
Together you're fueling
what he's doing.

474
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:12,369
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

475
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,859
-I'm here, Ms. Luthor.
-Okay, careful.

476
00:27:23,903 --> 00:27:27,210
Now, at the base of the
nearest dish, there should
be an access panel.

477
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,259
It's locked, and the keypad's
rigged to blow.

478
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,956
Damn it, Lex.

479
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,566
We only have three minutes.

480
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,309
Well, it's a group of
satellite dishes
aimed at the sky.

481
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,702
Lex loved symbolism.

482
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:43,574
Perhaps the code has
something to do with Heaven.

483
00:27:43,618 --> 00:27:45,533
-Or Hell.
-John Milton.

484
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:47,840
What was Lex's favorite quote
from Paradise Lost?

485
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:50,451
"Arise or be forever fallen."

486
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,110
It worked.

487
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:00,026
Manually positioning
the dishes.

488
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:05,118
Elevation, 14.9.
Azimuth, 253.1.

489
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:08,948
Ms. Luthor, we are locked
and ready to launch Myriad.

490
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,514
Amazing, Hope. You've done it.

491
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:14,301
And now, so will I.

492
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:20,699
Myriad has launched!

493
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,397
Of course it has.

494
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,704
We have 30 seconds until
the first Q-waves reach Earth.

495
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:30,970
Launch the interception.

496
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,810
Malefic's intercept is working.

497
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:48,727
Wait.

498
00:28:49,466 --> 00:28:50,641
No, no, no.

499
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,733
No, it's not working.

500
00:28:54,776 --> 00:28:57,997
Malefic's Q-wave energy output
is just shy of the power
we need to stop Myriad.

501
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,999
Is there any way
to up the power?

502
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,914
We can turn off
our Psychic Inhibitors.

503
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:03,916
-Don't even joke about that.
-I'm not joking.

504
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:07,789
The Inhibitors absorb
6% of Malefic's energy output,
or 4,000 terawatts.

505
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,618
If we want to increase
his power by the necessary 6%,

506
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,881
we have to remove
the Inhibitors from
the equation. It's basic math.

507
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,275
I will not expose
my agents to that risk.

508
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,799
That assumes there is a risk.

509
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,583
J'onn said
his brother has changed.

510
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:37,863
Two minutes
until the volcano explodes,

511
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,734
and ten seconds
until Myriad reaches Earth.

512
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,128
Do we turn off our Inhibitors
or do we activate Claymore?

513
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:45,958
Seven seconds, Director.
Five. Alex!

514
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:48,090
All agents,
Inhibitors off, now.

515
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,059
What's happening?

516
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,978
See, that's the problem
with you superheroes.

517
00:30:06,021 --> 00:30:08,023
You align yourselves
with the weak.

518
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,895
You fight for these humans,

519
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:13,986
but time after time,
all they do is destroy
everything around them.

520
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:15,117
You're one to talk.

521
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:18,555
Oh, I admit, I destroy.

522
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,514
But with a cleansing fire.

523
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,473
That's the only way to deal
with the scourge of humanity.

524
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:26,172
I have been here
for millions of years.

525
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:29,262
It's how it's always been...

526
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:32,482
and how it always will be.

527
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,150
Supergirl?

528
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,674
Can you hear me?
Mal stopped Myriad.
Where are you with Rama Khan?

529
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,161
Don't you see?

530
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,599
People never change.

531
00:31:02,643 --> 00:31:07,735
No, Rama Khan. You're wrong.
People can change.

532
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:10,346
That is what is so beautiful
about this world.

533
00:31:30,714 --> 00:31:32,151
You did it.

534
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,370
-You stopped the volcano.
-You knocked his block off.

535
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,852
-No!

536
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:44,032
They stopped Myriad.
I don't understand.

537
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,599
There's nothing to understand.

538
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:48,907
I lost.

539
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,388
This is a life lesson to learn.

540
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:56,175
Sometimes
the good guys don't win.

541
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,628
Enough.

542
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,673
It's over, Rama Khan.

543
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,982
What are you
talking about, Gamemnae?

544
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:23,985
The planets are still aligned.
There's still time!

545
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,073
Not for you.

546
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,164
Not anymore.

547
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,340
I can still finish this.

548
00:32:31,384 --> 00:32:34,953
You've had your last go.
Your reign is over.

549
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,874
She'll have
something to say about this.

550
00:32:43,918 --> 00:32:45,964
Who do you think appointed me?

551
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:53,928
This is not over!

552
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,509
I'm sorry I failed.

553
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,121
I wish there was more
I could do for you, Ms. Luthor.

554
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:14,818
There is.

555
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,046
I see.

556
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,223
Lena Luthor? Hands in the air.

557
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:32,140
It wasn't her. It was me.
I did all of it.

558
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:33,794
Drop the gun.
You're surrounded.

559
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:35,535
Eve, please.

560
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:43,673
Take her away.

561
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:53,292
Ms. Luthor, you all right?

562
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,949
You okay?

563
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:01,996
I'm gonna be scraping mud
out of my cape for a week.

564
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,347
No, I mean, are you okay?

565
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,871
I don't know.

566
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:11,092
Me neither.

567
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:16,445
When the FBI went
to arrest Lena,
Eve Tessmacher was there.

568
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:18,230
She confessed
to the whole thing.

569
00:34:18,273 --> 00:34:23,104
Had proof that
she impersonated Lena.
Had proof for all of it.

570
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,150
I wish that were true.

571
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,890
Well, we recovered Myriad,

572
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,111
but you know Lena.

573
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,200
-She's not gonna stop.
-I know.

574
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:36,117
She's alive, thanks to you.

575
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,640
Well, and to you.

576
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:42,515
I mean, you were right
about saving Lena, and Malefic.

577
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:44,908
He changed.

578
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,781
Well, thank you
for trusting him, and me.

579
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:51,306
You had a lot more faith
about that than I did.

580
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,569
Well, if we can
save Malefic's soul...

581
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,224
Maybe we can save Lena's.

582
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,447
But that is for another day.

583
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,884
Kelly and I are gonna
get some sushi.
You wanna join?

584
00:35:04,493 --> 00:35:06,234
No, no, you go ahead.

585
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,149
Okay.

586
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:38,136
I'm Andrea, by the way.

587
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:40,616
Oh, I know. I'm Russell Rogers.

588
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:43,315
See you tonight?

589
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:44,707
Yes.

590
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:47,362
It's over.

591
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:49,451
I finally did the right thing.

592
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,889
I'm just sorry
that it's too late.

593
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,068
I wish I could have saved you.

594
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:28,403
You saved us, Mal.

595
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:31,450
But how can I ever make up
for what I've done?

596
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:33,103
If only things were different.

597
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:36,063
There is a way.

598
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:38,326
And there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

599
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,722
Her name is M'gann.
She's a friend of mine.

600
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:45,290
And she's a White Martian
resistance fighter.

601
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:47,553
She can help you
when you arrive.

602
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,164
Can't believe
the war still rages.

603
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:53,559
-The war that I helped fuel.
-But you can go home now.

604
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:56,214
You can help
extinguish those flames.

605
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,306
But what if I can't?

606
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,177
I'm not strong like you, J'onn.

607
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:07,442
-H'ronmeer never
had a role for me--
-This is your role.

608
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,097
You know the White Martians,

609
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,578
you understand them,
you know how they think.

610
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:14,449
You can appeal to them.

611
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,670
Malefic, you can
bring peace to Mars

612
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,933
for the first time
in hundreds of years.

613
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,718
We can start anew.

614
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:27,419
You were never meant
to be the pariah, Malefic.

615
00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:29,334
You were meant
to be the promise.

616
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:33,990
Thank you, my brother.

617
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,645
I will strive
to make you proud.

618
00:37:38,168 --> 00:37:40,301
And to end what I helped start.

619
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,130
Not without this you won't.

620
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,965
Not a scratch on it.

621
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,054
I'll do my best.

622
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,295
Well done, J'onn J'onzz.

623
00:38:19,688 --> 00:38:22,300
-You passed the test.
-Test?

624
00:38:25,607 --> 00:38:27,696
You released my brother
from the Phantom Zone?

625
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:30,830
You brought my brother here?

626
00:38:30,873 --> 00:38:33,659
When I saw you fight
in Elseworlds,

627
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:37,140
I could see that
you were a great warrior,

628
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:41,580
but one plagued by his past,
and that made you vulnerable.

629
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:44,409
You believed it was
because you had left Mars,

630
00:38:44,452 --> 00:38:47,673
but it was something
far, far greater, J'onn.

631
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,197
Your brother.

632
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,330
But now that you have
faced those demons,

633
00:38:52,373 --> 00:38:56,899
you have come to learn
your vulnerabilities
are your strengths.

634
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,554
And now you are ready.

635
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,818
Ready for what?

636
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:05,647
A crisis.

637
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,487
Checkmate. Again.

638
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,539
Finally, you've returned.

639
00:39:27,582 --> 00:39:28,975
I don't know
if anybody's told you this,

640
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,499
but the feng shui of this place
is a bit stale.

641
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:35,460
I brought you back
because the universe
will need a mind like yours.

642
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:38,071
Someone who can
checkmate anyone?

643
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:42,380
The time has come
for you to fulfill
your destiny, Lex Luthor.

644
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:46,558
You can now become the hero
that you have longed to be.

645
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:49,387
I've always been the hero.

646
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,695
Happy to help.

647
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,920
But first,
we have to discuss my sister.

648
00:40:12,105 --> 00:40:16,326
For so many years,
I've travelled across worlds,

649
00:40:18,677 --> 00:40:21,070
across the multi-verse,
to do one thing.

650
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:22,985
To kill you.

651
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,553
And now, we're here.

652
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,774
You saved my life.

653
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:32,734
Submit
and begin your life anew.

654
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,389
Show me.

655
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,087
The knowledge is within you.
