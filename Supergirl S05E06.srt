1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,350
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:02,393 --> 00:00:04,613
Do what
Lex Luthor failed to do.

3
00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:06,093
Change the world.

4
00:00:06,136 --> 00:00:09,183
Rip Roar murdered
my best friend,
Russell Rogers.

5
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:10,749
The DEO caught Rip Roar

6
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:13,143
and they were able to ID him.
It's Russell.

7
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:14,840
I sold CatCo to Andrea.

8
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:16,320
She and I go way back,

9
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:17,495
since boarding school.

10
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:19,193
Jack Spheer and I,
we used to be close.

11
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,499
-Until when?
-Just before I moved
to National City.

12
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:24,328
You have the ability
to incept thoughts
into people's minds.

13
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,852
I want to study your brain,
so I can develop a technology

14
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,115
that can do the same thing.

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,725
Alex!

16
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,554
What just killed her?

17
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,870
Thank you for coming
down here, William.

18
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:47,090
Kara said if anyone would be
able to reach Rip Roar,

19
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,352
it would be you.

20
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,486
Russell's still in there,
I know it,

21
00:00:51,529 --> 00:00:54,010
but he must be acting
against his will.

22
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,057
The man I knew
could've never done
all of those terrible things.

23
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,233
Yes, 18 assassinations,

24
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,669
plus one ecological
terror attack.

25
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:04,107
-A thwarted terror attack.

26
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,891
Well, we know Rip Roar
is working for someone.

27
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,242
I'm going to find out who
and why they did this to him.

28
00:01:08,285 --> 00:01:10,331
I can confirm that his biotech
is still shielding him

29
00:01:10,374 --> 00:01:11,854
from the power
of our Truth Seeker.

30
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,682
Can't we take that
biotech off?

31
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:16,250
Whoever did this to him
attached incredibly
sophisticated technology

32
00:01:16,293 --> 00:01:17,773
to his nervous system.

33
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,601
If we remove it incorrectly,
it may kill him.

34
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,299
We've been breached.

35
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:24,345
Initiate emergency protocol,
secure the facility,

36
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:26,216
Brainy, I want
that power back up.

37
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:28,784
Alex, the shadow.

38
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,787
- Where'd she go?

39
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,840
I can't get her.

40
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,289
It's after Rip Roar.

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,552
Stay right here.

42
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:06,822
I don't know who
or what you are.

43
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,954
This is my prisoner
and if you touch him,

44
00:02:08,998 --> 00:02:10,304
I will light you up.

45
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,446
She's gone.

46
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,340
Andrea.

47
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:47,906
What do you want?

48
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,734
I need your help.

49
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,696
I need to break in
to the DEO.

50
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,742
What's the DEO?

51
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,309
Stop it.

52
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:00,658
I know you've had
government contracts

53
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,356
with them before,
that's why I'm here.

54
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,227
Okay.

55
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,708
Say we both know
what the DEO is.

56
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:10,277
Why does the head of
a Fortune 500 company
need access?

57
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,240
I know who was behind
the tidal wave that
almost took out

58
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,024
National City.

59
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,331
I know because
I work for them.

60
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:23,986
But if I tell who
they are, they'll kill me.

61
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:25,857
And you too.

62
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:29,600
The DEO captured the agent
that started the tidal wave.

63
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:34,953
The people I work for
want me to kill him
before he can talk.

64
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,042
Andrea, you come to my house
and ask for my help

65
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,349
to kill someone,
are you crazy?

66
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,874
You know, I do know
the director of the DEO.

67
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,137
What's to stop me from
calling her right now
and reporting you?

68
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,922
Because I don't want
to kill him.

69
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,794
I want to save him.

70
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,233
He's important to me.

71
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,625
I can breach the facility.

72
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:56,410
But Supergirl is
guarding him personally

73
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,933
and I can't get past her.

74
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:02,111
You've worked
for her before.

75
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,765
-Maybe you can.
-No.

76
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:05,854
Sorry.

77
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,247
Lena...

78
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,379
I'm asking as a friend.

79
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:10,859
We're not friends.

80
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,567
We used to be.

81
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,320
Hey.

82
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,887
You're Lena,
the new kid, right?

83
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,324
I'm Andrea.

84
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,370
My parents didn't come
for visitor day either.

85
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:44,675
Why didn't they come?

86
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,547
My father runs
a very successful business.

87
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,811
So he's, you know,
busy.

88
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:52,161
Mother, on the other hand,
is in Paris.

89
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:55,033
I don't interest her nearly
as much as her friend,

90
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:55,991
the baron.

91
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,081
What about your mom?
Let me guess.

92
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:01,649
-She's off screwing a duke?
-My mother's dead.

93
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,042
Oh.

94
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,916
Hey.

95
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,484
What do you say
we go to a real party tonight?

96
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,837
Van Horne's is
my father's favorite drink.

97
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,274
It's top, top shelf.

98
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,362
He didn't even card us.

99
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,190
Why would he?
We're 21.

100
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,539
-No, we're not.
-Lena...

101
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:25,194
The key to getting
what you want is confidence.

102
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,153
Act like you already have it
and no one will question us.

103
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,508
Come on.

104
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:36,161
Favorite movie...

105
00:05:36,205 --> 00:05:37,815
One, two, three.

106
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:38,816
Titanic.

107
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,429
I saw it eight times
in the theater.

108
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,908
Six times for me.

109
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:46,084
My brother mocked me
relentlessly.

110
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,826
Screw the haters,
we should all live like Rose.

111
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,654
Do you wanna meet
your soulmate

112
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,482
only to watch him
die tragically?

113
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:55,224
No, Rose post -Titanic,

114
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:56,617
-Rose Dawson.
-Oh.

115
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,706
She went out there
and grabbed life,

116
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:00,185
didn't waste a single moment.

117
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:03,188
That's my dream,
go everywhere,

118
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,668
experience everything,

119
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,454
all while taking my dad's
company to the next level.

120
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,544
-Those are lofty goals.
-That's what makes it fun.

121
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,982
I have a dream like that.

122
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,071
Lofty?

123
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:17,855
Impossible.

124
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:19,553
Well, now you have
to tell me

125
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:24,253
My mother used to always
tell me this story

126
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:26,429
about the medallion
of the Acrata.

127
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,213
It's about this girl
whose village

128
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,867
was being ravaged
by darkness,

129
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,827
so she went into the wild
in search of magic
that could help.

130
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,958
What happens?

131
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,700
She finds the medallion
of Acrata

132
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,354
and was bestowed great gifts

133
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,790
so that she alone had
the strength

134
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:41,575
to bend shadow
to her will.

135
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:42,793
Did your mom make it up?

136
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,969
She found it
in an old storybook.

137
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,450
She was obsessed.

138
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,583
She'd talk about it
like it was real.

139
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:52,455
She'd draw the symbol
everywhere.

140
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,762
Is that what you were doodling
in your notebook?

141
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,721
She said when I got older,

142
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:01,029
when things were better,

143
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:03,597
that we would go
on a quest to find it.

144
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,773
Together.

145
00:07:08,297 --> 00:07:09,951
It's stupid.
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:11,387
No, it's not stupid,

147
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,737
sometimes these legends
are based in fact,

148
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:16,131
and if this medallion
is real,

149
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:17,567
I'll help you find it.

150
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:19,569
-You will?
-Like Rose says,

151
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,223
"You jump, I jump."

152
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,144
We just made
first contact with
an alien race

153
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,451
and even apart from
the existential threat

154
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:34,454
that he poses
to our entire species,

155
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,933
I mean, how can
we measure up?

156
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:41,635
From now on, this...

157
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,072
is Luther Corp.

158
00:07:44,115 --> 00:07:46,770
This is insane,
your obsession
with killing Superman.

159
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,555
We're supposed to help people.

160
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,776
I think Spheerical Industries
is hiring.

161
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,474
If I don't help you
murder Superman,

162
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,823
you're firing me?

163
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:02,003
I am not gonna
let you kill him.

164
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,442
Papa,
you almost ready?

165
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,052
The car's waiting.

166
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,445
The new
T-Pixel 8 will excite...

167
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,403
Papa, you have
to get dressed,

168
00:08:11,447 --> 00:08:14,319
we have Obsidian Worldwide's
new phone launch in an hour.

169
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:18,193
-The press is waiting.
-No, they're not.

170
00:08:18,236 --> 00:08:23,677
Lord Industry just announced
a new T-Pixel 8.

171
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,985
The chip is four times faster
than ours.

172
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,987
Four times?
That's impossible.

173
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:33,730
We are going to
lose billions.

174
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:40,215
We have to let go
of 70% of the company

175
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,260
by Christmas.

176
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,349
If my company is worthless,

177
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,830
my life is worthless.

178
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,707
Why is your
life insurance policy out?

179
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,884
-You promised you wouldn't
do this again, Papa.

180
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,976
You are the best thing
in my life.

181
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,022
I refuse to ruin you.

182
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:09,853
Go and do something
better, mi cielito.

183
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,860
Consider yourself fired.

184
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,523
Lena.

185
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,308
You're just the voice
I needed to hear right now.

186
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:33,137
We won't know how bad
things really are for us

187
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,835
until next week
when the board decides

188
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:38,969
to either push the launch
of the phone
or kill it completely.

189
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:42,582
Papa's locked himself
away in his lab till then.

190
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,888
I've seen him bad before
but never like this.

191
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:46,237
The way he looked yesterday,

192
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:48,283
it scared me.

193
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:52,766
Oh, how about you?
How are things going
in Luther Corp?

194
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:59,337
You're not the only one
with family business problems.

195
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:03,690
Lex is completely unhinged.

196
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:07,737
His obsession with Superman
is out of control.

197
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,435
He'll stop at nothing
to kill him

198
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:13,351
and I am very afraid
that a lot of people are
going to get hurt...

199
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:15,571
or killed in the process.

200
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,442
-Can't you stop him?
-He pushed me out.

201
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,968
I mean,
Lex's latest plan is to seed
the atmosphere with Kryptonite.

202
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,013
What is Kryptonite?

203
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,667
According to Lex,
it's Superman's
greatest weakness.

204
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,538
-Can he do it?
-No, not yet.

205
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:29,324
First, he has to figure out
how to sublimate it into vapor,

206
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:33,633
but he has this mad theory
that this ancient alien element

207
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:35,460
is going to help him do that.

208
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,811
I mean, this element
crash-landed on Earth
millions of years ago.

209
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,987
All I need to do to...

210
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,207
save humanity
from Lex's madness is...

211
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,733
find the element first.

212
00:10:46,776 --> 00:10:49,213
You already found it,
didn't you?

213
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,693
Thanks to you.

214
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,695
Okay, so do you remember
your anthropology dissertation

215
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,611
about the Aztec village
that lived in the shadow
of the volcano

216
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,786
but never got covered in lava

217
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,309
no matter how much
the volcano erupted?

218
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,181
And you think that's
where the alien element is?

219
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:03,271
I did an intensive
satellite scan of the area

220
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:04,838
and I found...

221
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,883
this.

222
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:12,497
It's that symbol
you used to draw.

223
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,673
The medallion
of Acrata.

224
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,849
What are the odds
that my mother's story

225
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,720
would lead me to the one thing
that has the properties I need
to stop my brother?

226
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,504
-It's crazy.
-It's fate.

227
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,942
All right, so that's where
the signature is strongest,

228
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,204
so we need to get to it.

229
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:24,814
We?

230
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,860
No, no, no,
I can't leave right now,
my father needs me.

231
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,775
I know,
but it's three days, tops,

232
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:31,038
I promise, and you yourself
said that the board

233
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,996
wasn't going to be making
a decision for another week.

234
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,781
Please.

235
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:36,565
My brother is in
a downward spiral

236
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:39,263
and I am the only one
who can save him from himself.

237
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,788
But I can't do it alone.

238
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:43,006
All right?
You studied this culture,

239
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,965
you know the area
and the language.

240
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,837
Besides, isn't it
what you always wanted?

241
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,057
To go out there
and grab life?

242
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,102
Come on.

243
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:54,278
What would Rose Dawson do?

244
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:57,934
"You jump, I jump, right?"

245
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:10,033
Maybe there's a way around it
or through it.

246
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:11,295
Wait.

247
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,041
"And when the world around her
turned to stone,

248
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:21,523
impenetrable by hope,
the girl looked down
to the core

249
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:26,180
and was shown the winding way."

250
00:12:26,963 --> 00:12:29,139
The snake,
it's an arrow,

251
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,185
we go this way.

252
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,274
That's impressive.

253
00:12:36,103 --> 00:12:38,540
The proverbial "X" must be
around here someplace.

254
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:40,803
Look.

255
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,544
Aztec serpent-headed flowers.

256
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:45,460
Didn't the girl
from the book
fight the head of a snake?

257
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,246
No!

258
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:52,510
Andrea.

259
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:53,903
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

260
00:12:53,947 --> 00:12:57,037
Yeah, still in one piece.

261
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,300
-I think.
-We'll make a rope ladder
and get you out.

262
00:12:59,343 --> 00:13:00,431
Stay right there.

263
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,368
Lena, wait.

264
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:34,596
-Andrea Rojas.

265
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:42,125
-Who are you?
-I am a messenger.

266
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,171
Nothing more, nothing less.

267
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:48,479
Serpent-headed flowers,
they have psychedelic
properties

268
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,873
and I'm hallucinating,
that's what this is.

269
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:53,397
Oh, this is very real,
I assure you.

270
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,922
As they are who sent me,

271
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:57,358
Leviathan.

272
00:13:58,446 --> 00:13:59,273
What do they want?

273
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,406
Your father, Bernardo Rojas,

274
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:04,844
he's not well, is he?

275
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,280
How do you...

276
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,023
He's a brilliant man.

277
00:14:10,066 --> 00:14:11,546
Things will turn around
for him.

278
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:14,462
He's not as strong
as you believe him to be,

279
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,419
mi cielito.

280
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:18,945
He's on the brink
of ending everything,

281
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,469
that is why
you devote yourself to him.

282
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,036
What do you want from me?

283
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:26,169
Your happiness
and your service,
one for the other.

284
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:28,998
-What does that mean?
-What matters now

285
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:32,175
is if you agree, your father
will live and live well.

286
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:35,222
All you have to do
is take this.

287
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,007
No.

288
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,053
No, no, no, I can't.

289
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,925
My friend Lena,
she needs this.

290
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,361
This is all she's ever wanted.

291
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,624
You want to save
your father or not?

292
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,409
Take the medallion.

293
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:49,453
Accept your fate.

294
00:15:02,597 --> 00:15:05,208
Keep it on you always.

295
00:15:05,252 --> 00:15:10,039
Never speak of it or all
that you love will be lost.

296
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:13,216
And remember,
there will come a day

297
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,392
when we will call upon you.

298
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,480
Be prepared.

299
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:19,919
- Andrea.

300
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,269
-I'll be right there.

301
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:28,014
Are you okay?
I was so worried.

302
00:15:28,057 --> 00:15:30,581
Yeah, I just wanna
get out of here.

303
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:31,452
Okay.

304
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:41,984
This is it, Andrea,
we found it.

305
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:43,507
It's the medallion.

306
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,206
These etchings, they match
the description in the story.

307
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:48,121
My calculations were right.

308
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:51,385
My mother was right.

309
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,346
But where is it? It looks like
it should be here.

310
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,131
Maybe someone
got to it first.

311
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,655
No, it has to be here,
it's supposed to be here,

312
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:03,005
there should be some
kind of trace, the satellites--

313
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,180
Are fallible.

314
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,444
You could have been
picking up anything.

315
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:10,186
Okay.

316
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,405
Okay, we'll keep looking,

317
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:12,710
we'll figure out who was here
and when--

318
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:16,062
Lena, look, finding this place
was hard enough.

319
00:16:16,105 --> 00:16:18,499
Seeing who came
before or after,

320
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,544
it's impossible.

321
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,592
I was so close.

322
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:27,334
I'm so sorry.

323
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:39,868
Papa?

324
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:43,306
No, no, I haven't.

325
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:47,658
Lord Industries is blowing up
the market literally.

326
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:50,226
Their latest smartphone
contains a faulty chip

327
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,533
causing devices
to explode.

328
00:16:52,576 --> 00:16:55,014
But their loss
is Obsidian Worldwide's gain.

329
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,059
Their stock hit
an all-time high today.

330
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:58,278
Papa.

331
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,063
That's incredible.

332
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:04,371
Now back to you, Rick.
-Thank you for that...

333
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:06,808
I think things are only going
to get better for us.

334
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:14,729
Ms. Luthor.

335
00:17:14,772 --> 00:17:16,557
Why did your brother
turn the sun red?

336
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:18,863
Superman.

337
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:19,734
Ms. Luthor won't be answering
any questions

338
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:20,865
without a lawyer present.

339
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:21,997
Jack.

340
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,520
I was such an idiot.

341
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,262
I thought I could
save him with what?

342
00:17:26,306 --> 00:17:29,787
-Magical thinking?
-You believed in
the good in him.

343
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,876
That means something.

344
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,661
-Does it?
-Let's get out of here,

345
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:34,966
out of town for a while.

346
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,405
I have that conference
in London, come with me.

347
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,893
You were right.

348
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,069
I needed this.

349
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,201
It's nice
to see you smiling again.

350
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:54,899
-Go be charming.
I'll get drinks.
-Right. Okay.

351
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,299
Andrea.

352
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,084
Lena.

353
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,955
I had no idea
you'd be here,

354
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,783
I didn't know that
you were in London.

355
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:11,568
Wait, what's that?

356
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:16,747
I knew it.

357
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,403
The medallion was there,
and you're the one that took it

358
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,405
even though you knew
how much it meant to me.

359
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:24,973
Why?

360
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,366
Look, there are things
I couldn't...

361
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,150
That I can't tell you.

362
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,892
You looked me in the eye
and you lied to me.

363
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:33,155
I trusted you
more than anyone in the world

364
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:35,244
and you made a fool out of me.

365
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,941
You know, I expect
this kind of betrayal

366
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:38,595
from the Luthors,
but not you.

367
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,555
-Lena, please.
-There's nothing you can say.

368
00:18:42,817 --> 00:18:43,861
We're done.

369
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:56,135
Ever since London,
you've been a completely
different person,

370
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,223
you've barely talked to me

371
00:18:57,266 --> 00:18:59,312
and now you're leaving
Metropolis?

372
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,444
It's my responsibility
to make up for the stain
my brother left on the world.

373
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:02,576
To do something good.

374
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:04,491
We were going
to do something good.

375
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:07,102
Together.
What about our company?

376
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,105
You see this? This is why
I need to be in National City.

377
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,629
There are people
doing good there,
who are trying to help.

378
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:14,675
If I stay in Metropolis,
I will always be the sister

379
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:17,330
of the egomaniacal lunatic,
but I go to National City,

380
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:19,288
I can be the Luthor
that shares her home

381
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,637
with a Kryptonian.

382
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,509
That helps her put the world
back together

383
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:24,119
instead of tearing it apart.

384
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,729
You know I can't leave, Lena.

385
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,605
I'm not asking you to.

386
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,476
So...

387
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,698
So you're choosing
to redeem the Luthor name?

388
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,569
Over me.

389
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,049
Over us.

390
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:43,051
Lena, please, look, talk to me.

391
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:44,400
You can trust me.

392
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,446
I can't trust anyone
anymore.

393
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:48,143
Going back to the studio.

394
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:52,234
And the trial of Lex Luthor continues to shock the nation,

395
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:55,237
painting a vivid picture
of just how far

396
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:58,501
the once great name
of Luthor has fallen.

397
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:06,553
I might be mistaken,
but I'm pretty sure
they call that a drink

398
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:08,598
'cause that's what
you're supposed to do with it.

399
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,038
I guess I'm not in the mood.

400
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,649
Oh.

401
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,652
I usually do all my drinking
when I feel the way you look.

402
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:22,395
Like you've just lost
your last friend in the world.

403
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:26,747
Well, I'm sure
you're very busy,
enjoy your drink.

404
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,315
Actually...

405
00:20:29,358 --> 00:20:31,578
I've got nothing
but free time right now.

406
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,536
I've been stood up.

407
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,191
-Ouch.
-That's all right.

408
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,671
I was going
to reject them anyway.

409
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:39,803
Then it all worked out.

410
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:43,416
-I guess it did.
-Hmm.

411
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,721
What about you?

412
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:49,552
What drove you
to a day of heavy non-drinking?

413
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:53,600
I had a big meeting
and I completely forgot
about it.

414
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,645
It's so unlike me,

415
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,560
I'm usually type A, but...

416
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,040
But the friend thing
got in the way.

417
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,565
Okay, how do you know that?

418
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:05,568
I didn't, I just have
a best friend too, that's all.

419
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:08,354
I'm Andrea, by the way.

420
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,920
Oh, I know.

421
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,487
I'm Russell Rogers.

422
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,054
You're the meeting I blew off?

423
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:18,233
-How long did you know?
-Only since you mentioned
a business meeting.

424
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,930
I swear.

425
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,759
Wait, you said that
you were gonna turn down
Obsidian's offer?

426
00:21:23,499 --> 00:21:25,762
Well, now,
this is awkward.

427
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:28,243
I'm afraid I can't accept
the position.

428
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,505
I'm starting my own company

429
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,768
focusing solely on
cyber-bionics.

430
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:34,597
-Oh.
-Which is fortuitous
on many levels.

431
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,558
But mostly because
I'd like to ask you to dinner.

432
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,429
Which could've gotten
very dicey

433
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,301
if you were my employer.

434
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,825
-So what do you say?

435
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,959
Breaking news
from National City.

436
00:21:49,003 --> 00:21:51,614
Lena Luthor, National City's
newest predominant resident,

437
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:53,790
was rescued from an assassination attempt today

438
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:57,011
by the Kryptonian duo of
Superman and Supergirl.

439
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:01,624
Well, if it isn't
National City's

440
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,452
newest hotshot reporter.

441
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,280
-I was just reading
your article.
-That's actually why I'm here,

442
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,805
I have to say thank you
for helping me find
that fight club.

443
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:11,634
You've been in the city a month
and you've already saved my job

444
00:22:11,678 --> 00:22:13,332
an embarrassing amount
of times.

445
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:16,030
Well, I am sure you will return
the favor when the time comes.

446
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,684
On that note,

447
00:22:17,727 --> 00:22:20,774
I also wanted to give you this.

448
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:23,559
Someone hacked into
the emails at L-Corp

449
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:25,692
and sent them
to CatCo anonymously.

450
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,346
I was able to snag the data

451
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,652
and there are some potentially
embarrassing things in there,

452
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,567
but for the most part,
it's not newsworthy.

453
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:33,308
I just remember you saying

454
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,005
you want to make a name
for yourself outside of
your family

455
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:38,400
and I would hate for
some jerk to ruin that.

456
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:41,534
I knew there'd been a breach
but I thought we caught
everything.

457
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:43,884
Thank you, Kara.

458
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,234
You know how you could
thank me?

459
00:22:46,277 --> 00:22:49,542
We have this game night thing
and my sister and I dominate

460
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:52,545
and we are in desperate need
of a worthy adversary.

461
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,851
I'm sorry, Kara,
when I said I wanted us

462
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:56,549
to have a positive
relationship,

463
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:58,594
it was because I thought
we could help each other.

464
00:22:58,638 --> 00:23:03,077
But let me be clear, I meant
a business relationship.

465
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,689
I would hate for you
to give me these emails

466
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:08,735
out of some misplaced
sense of friendship.

467
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,346
I didn't come here
to make friends,

468
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,608
so by all means,

469
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,044
publish the emails.

470
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,872
I would never do that, Lena.

471
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:19,049
But if you change your mind,
the invite always stands.

472
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:20,268
Every Friday night.

473
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,231
How can a vegan restaurant
not identify itself?

474
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:29,451
-It's cruel.
-I know.

475
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:32,280
Our six-month
anniversary ruined.

476
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,108
You know, I vote
for a do-over.

477
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:36,632
Barbecue?

478
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,199
Stop talking so sexy.

479
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,989
-See you tonight?
-Yes.

480
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:49,036
-Ah.

481
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,086
He's very handsome.

482
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,828
Sorry, I don't have
any cash on me.

483
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,178
I don't need your money,
just what you promised.

484
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,311
Your service.

485
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,705
You knew there would be a time

486
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:07,794
when Leviathan
would call on you.

487
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:13,016
What do you want from me?

488
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,628
Go to this location,

489
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:18,282
find the man on this card

490
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:19,240
and kill him.

491
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:25,594
-I'm not a killer.
-You are what we say you are.

492
00:24:25,638 --> 00:24:28,118
You weren't successful
and then we said you were.

493
00:24:28,162 --> 00:24:31,818
Your father was suicidal
and now he's not.

494
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:35,343
Did you really think all of
this didn't come with a price?

495
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:37,693
I won't do it.

496
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,782
You refuse us, but...

497
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:43,003
a day from now your father
will be accused of
insider trading,

498
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:46,572
stocks will tumble,
the company will be decimated.

499
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,138
One night,
while awaiting trial,

500
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,489
your father will put on
his striped pajamas,

501
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,360
he will take the elevator
to the roof

502
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:53,840
and when he steps up
on the ledge,

503
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:56,059
his last words will be,

504
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,801
"I failed you, mi cielito."

505
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:08,985
Listen to me very carefully.

506
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:12,467
Take the medallion,
tap it three times,

507
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,860
you'll know what to do.

508
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:44,717
Governor Harper?

509
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,327
Governor Harper!

510
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:53,682
Last month, Cat Grant
joined the Marsdin
administration

511
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:58,861
and since her appointment,
she's made a big impact.
Today in technology news...

512
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,167
Lena.

513
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,516
-Kara.
-Hi.

514
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,692
-Hi, it's really good
to see you.

515
00:26:03,736 --> 00:26:05,738
-Are you waiting for someone?
-Not today,

516
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:07,174
I have a hot date
with some spreadsheets.

517
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,741
Oh.

518
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:11,308
I'm actually meeting
my sister here, she loves it.

519
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:14,311
She makes us order
every appetizer on the menu.

520
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,838
Actually, I'm lying,
I'm the one that orders
all the appetizers.

521
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:21,971
-That sounds like fun.
-Yeah.

522
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,756
Look, I heard you when you said

523
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:25,409
you didn't wanna connect
with anyone

524
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,629
but I've been
the new girl in town

525
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:29,457
and I put my guards up too.

526
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,634
But I was miserable.

527
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,681
And if I hadn't let someone in,
my sister,

528
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:36,943
actually...

529
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:40,120
I think I would've drowned
in it.

530
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:43,776
Oh.

531
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,343
And...

532
00:26:46,387 --> 00:26:48,868
I guess my sister has to work.

533
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:51,087
I... You do, too,

534
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,220
I'm sorry,
I'll leave you alone.

535
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:56,484
Kara.

536
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:01,924
Don't be ridiculous,
you can't eat all
those apps on your own.

537
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,752
Why don't you join me.

538
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:05,058
Really?

539
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:08,757
Okay, but I'm warning you,

540
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:09,932
people have been
underestimating

541
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,021
how much I can eat
for years.

542
00:27:12,065 --> 00:27:13,327
Oh, game on.

543
00:27:15,895 --> 00:27:17,940
-You all right?
-Russ.

544
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,813
Hey, you're home early.

545
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,036
What's going on?

546
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,343
Something's been off
with you for weeks.

547
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,738
I'm worried
you're into something bad.

548
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:34,478
Something dangerous.

549
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,220
It's just, um...

550
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,528
A private family thing.

551
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,705
Look, I'm exhausted,

552
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:45,228
I'm gonna go take a shower.

553
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:12,255
What are you doing?
No, stop!

554
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:14,170
You know Leviathan
required complete discretion.

555
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:17,043
You were careless,
he got too close.

556
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:19,088
Our secrets are more important
than any life.

557
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:21,874
No, no, no,
he's a good person.

558
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:24,224
This isn't his fault,
please.

559
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,878
Finish it, make it look like
a home invasion.

560
00:28:25,921 --> 00:28:27,836
No, wait!

561
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:29,577
He can help you.

562
00:28:30,404 --> 00:28:31,622
This is Russell Rogers,

563
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,886
he's working on
medical advancements.

564
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:36,279
He has a prototype
that can bring soldiers back

565
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:38,542
from the brink of death
and then some.

566
00:28:39,195 --> 00:28:40,849
He can be very useful to you.

567
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,481
It's okay.

568
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:23,979
Your friends...

569
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:27,069
have been lying to you
from the start.

570
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:32,031
Every last one.

571
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,425
...the last five years.

572
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:37,427
And we have an update
on the Lex Luthor story.

573
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,996
Lex Luthor and his master plan to manipulate the Kaznians.

574
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,520
The Girl of Steel
saves the day again.

575
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:46,610
-Supergirl saved--
-Obsidian Worldwide
announced this week

576
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:49,265
that they will be opening a new branch to be spearheaded

577
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:53,269
by CEO Bernardo Rojas'
daughter Andrea Rojas.

578
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,445
Obsidian's entrance into
the North American market

579
00:29:55,489 --> 00:29:57,578
marks a turning point
for the company,

580
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:00,189
which has thus far avoided
the American market.

581
00:30:00,233 --> 00:30:03,671
CEO Bernando Rojas,
once a gallant trailblazer...

582
00:30:20,688 --> 00:30:22,385
I never needed them.

583
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:26,607
Any of them.

584
00:30:30,524 --> 00:30:32,613
But that doesn't mean
they can't be useful.

585
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,791
I was glad to get
a call from you, Lena.

586
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,184
I've missed you.

587
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,403
It's been a long time.

588
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,493
I thought I'd never
hear from you again.

589
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:47,323
Well, I was thinking...

590
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:49,151
that you and I have too much
to offer each other

591
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,850
to let ancient history
get in the way of
a potential partnership.

592
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,416
Okay.

593
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,896
I'm listening.

594
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,334
Well, I'm sure you've heard
of Lex's latest misdeeds.

595
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,859
He's left me with
quite a mess to clean up.

596
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,295
Financially.

597
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,994
So I'm selling CatCo.

598
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:09,693
-That's a shame.
-I'm glad you think so.

599
00:31:09,737 --> 00:31:12,609
Because I believe
I've found the perfect
person to take it over.

600
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:14,568
You.

601
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,005
I already run a tech company.

602
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:21,183
Tech gets you money,
but media gets you control of
the markets.

603
00:31:21,227 --> 00:31:23,925
And CatCo would be the perfect
advertising platform

604
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,709
for Obsidian.

605
00:31:25,753 --> 00:31:26,797
That's an interesting thought,

606
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:28,495
I've honestly never
considered it.

607
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:29,757
You should.

608
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,063
And I know you've been
looking for a place

609
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:33,979
for Obsidian North's
new headquarters.

610
00:31:34,022 --> 00:31:36,024
I think National City
could be a good fit.

611
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,374
It would be nice
to be in the same city again.

612
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:40,681
Just like old times.

613
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,165
Why don't we discuss
the details?

614
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,520
Every time I look at you,

615
00:31:53,563 --> 00:31:55,957
I'm reminded of all
the horrible things I've done.

616
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:58,177
Honey, every time
I look at you,

617
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,743
all I remember is pain.

618
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:02,616
Lena, for so long I wanted
to tell you the truth, but...

619
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,531
I was scared.

620
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:05,793
That medallion was
the only thing

621
00:32:05,836 --> 00:32:06,968
that could've stopped
my brother

622
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:09,275
-and you knew that.
-Everything I did,

623
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:12,278
every decision was to save
my father's life.

624
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:15,281
My brother was
a homicidal maniac.

625
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:18,240
A lot of innocent people
are dead because of him,
because of you.

626
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:21,548
I am well aware of how much
blood there is on my hands.

627
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:24,420
And I'm so sorry.

628
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:25,552
Because you say you're sorry,

629
00:32:25,595 --> 00:32:27,423
it doesn't make
everything better.

630
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,425
Okay? How am I supposed
to believe you now?

631
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:32,167
Because you were right
all along.

632
00:32:37,738 --> 00:32:39,305
It was magical.

633
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,534
Lena.

634
00:32:57,149 --> 00:33:00,369
"And she had the strength
to bend shadow to her will."

635
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:02,502
It wasn't a metaphor
about overcoming darkness,

636
00:33:02,545 --> 00:33:05,461
-it was literal.
-It came with the ability
to move through shadows.

637
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,463
And you've had
this ability the whole time?

638
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:10,205
It's not a gift,
it's a curse.

639
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:12,077
I never wanted to betray you.

640
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,862
But my father,
he was gonna die...

641
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,388
so I did what I had to do.

642
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:23,697
But it cost me the love of
my life and my best friend.

643
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:29,964
Taking this from you was
the biggest mistake of my life.

644
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,097
I know I've done
terrible things.

645
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,316
But this is my chance
to do something good.

646
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,712
Please, you have to believe me.

647
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:46,763
I believe you.

648
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,897
I'm tired of people
hurting each other.

649
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:52,117
Doing harm.

650
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,250
So you'll help me?

651
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:58,732
"You jump, I jump, right?"

652
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:04,868
-Did Brainy say anything?
-Not yet.

653
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:07,915
But there is an old piece
of Cadmus tech in the vaults

654
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,135
that could help us
remove his biotech

655
00:34:10,178 --> 00:34:12,093
and force an answer
out of him.

656
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:13,573
So I'll go get it.

657
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:17,794
William told me about you,

658
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,015
well, he told me about Russell,
how good a friend he was,

659
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,278
how devastating
it was to lose him.

660
00:34:23,322 --> 00:34:25,367
You know,
William sacrificed everything,

661
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:27,369
dedicated himself
to finding out

662
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,676
what happened to Russell.

663
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,373
So I guess you must've been
pretty special.

664
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,027
The person William knew
is gone.

665
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,289
I don't agree.

666
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,595
I think you're working
for someone

667
00:34:35,638 --> 00:34:38,119
and they're forcing you
to do these things.

668
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:39,729
I know you feel
you've gone too far

669
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:40,904
to ever be Russell again

670
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,297
but you're wrong.

671
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:45,126
It is never too late
to try to make things right.

672
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,780
Or at least better.

673
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:49,217
Who did this to you?

674
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:50,653
I can keep you safe.

675
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,396
They're called Leviathan.

676
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:00,837
Good.

677
00:35:00,881 --> 00:35:02,187
Now here's how this will go.

678
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,536
I'll handle Supergirl.

679
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:08,715
I have to go, um...

680
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:09,803
Thank you.

681
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,113
Lena. Lena?

682
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,245
-Lena. Lena.
-Kara.

683
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,204
Oh, thank God you're here.
It was horrible,

684
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,162
it was here one minute
and gone the next,

685
00:35:21,206 --> 00:35:22,729
she's like a shadow.

686
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:25,079
I'll jam all incoming signals.

687
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,559
I've recently developed
a device

688
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:28,038
that can incept
a single thought

689
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,432
into the surrounding area,
"Do no harm."

690
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,782
Plant it at the DEO.

691
00:35:32,826 --> 00:35:35,307
It will disable all agents
that get in your way.

692
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,179
I'll control it from here

693
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,007
and then the DEO is yours.

694
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,017
J'onn, is everything okay?

695
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,019
I felt a psychic attack
at the DEO.

696
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:53,977
It felt like my brother.

697
00:35:54,021 --> 00:35:55,196
That's impossible.

698
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,458
There must be something else.

699
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,417
I just have a bad feeling.

700
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,810
Well, we still have
the psychic inhibitor buds.

701
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,030
-I'll be careful.
-Okay, see you soon.

702
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:17,523
Supergirl, I think we have
a bit of a situation here.

703
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:21,353
Supergirl, do you copy?

704
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:41,024
Director Danvers.

705
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,462
Agent Dox, someone
incepted the DEO,

706
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:44,593
we're the only two unaffected.

707
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,856
That is an erroneous
assumption.

708
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,558
We must do no harm.

709
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:02,568
Sorry, Brainy.

710
00:37:10,445 --> 00:37:11,533
I knew I felt something.

711
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,100
Where is Supergirl?

712
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,669
Oh, hell no.

713
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,714
-Make sure the shadow
doesn't get to Rip Roar.
-Right.

714
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,556
Supergirl!

715
00:37:35,731 --> 00:37:37,820
Alex is in trouble,
stay here.

716
00:37:38,821 --> 00:37:40,127
No, no.

717
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,746
If you think
you can hurt my friends,

718
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,966
to get me out of the way,
you got another thing coming.

719
00:37:57,623 --> 00:38:00,800
Please don't fight.
I want to help you.

720
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:09,896
No!

721
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,340
Lena, I honestly don't know
how I can ever repay you.

722
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:21,124
You can start by
giving me the medallion.

723
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:22,474
I can't.

724
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:26,869
You'd incept me
to give you this.

725
00:38:26,913 --> 00:38:28,001
Much worse.

726
00:38:29,524 --> 00:38:30,917
Russell, pick up the scalpel.

727
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,881
Now hold it
to your carotid artery.

728
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,321
And press. Slowly.

729
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,452
Please, Lena, don't do this.

730
00:38:44,496 --> 00:38:45,627
Then give me the medallion.

731
00:38:46,976 --> 00:38:48,761
This is what
you wanted this whole time.

732
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:51,677
I helped you save Russell,
now I want what I deserve.

733
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,505
I was desperate,
my father was weak,

734
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,376
he was going to die.
Everything I did,

735
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,551
I did for love.

736
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,466
That's what hurt the most.

737
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,555
I cared about you more than
anyone else in the world

738
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,688
and I never
would've betrayed you.

739
00:39:07,867 --> 00:39:09,912
I told you this thing
is a curse.

740
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,220
Our friendship was the curse.

741
00:39:14,439 --> 00:39:16,223
Russell, put the scalpel down.

742
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:19,226
-Now go, both of you.

743
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:30,542
Malefic must've been
working with the assassin.

744
00:39:30,585 --> 00:39:31,891
How else could he have
incepted everyone?

745
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:34,197
Believe me, I want to know
who is responsible,

746
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:35,547
but Malefic did not do this.

747
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,852
So we're back to square one.

748
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:39,333
We're not,
I got something from Rip Roar.

749
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,813
A name.

750
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:42,858
Leviathan.

751
00:39:42,902 --> 00:39:44,599
We'll start gathering intel
immediately.

752
00:39:44,643 --> 00:39:47,167
Okay, but I have to break
some bad news first.

753
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,388
- Russell got away.

754
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:51,911
The same operative
that attacked yesterday

755
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:55,088
came again, they worked
as a team and now he's gone.

756
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,395
I'm so sorry.

757
00:39:57,438 --> 00:39:59,658
I was wrong about him
all along.

758
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:01,964
No, I don't think you were.

759
00:40:02,008 --> 00:40:05,446
Supergirl told us he's been
working against his will.

760
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,579
I don't think he ever meant
to betray you.

761
00:40:10,016 --> 00:40:12,018
I'm sorry,
if it weren't for me,

762
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:14,150
they never would've
come for you.

763
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:19,025
You saved my life.

764
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,288
Even before that,
you made it worth living.

765
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,555
No. Russ, no, no, Russ.

766
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,297
No, no, no!

767
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:31,733
Somebody help, please.

768
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,866
Russ! Please, somebody help!

769
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,695
You can't escape us,

770
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:40,438
nor the powers
we bestowed upon you.

771
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:42,918
I don't even have
the medallion anymore.

772
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:44,180
What do you want?

773
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,444
The powers never came
from the medallion.

774
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,836
It activated them.

775
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,057
But they came from the darkness
within you.

776
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:54,495
And that is something
you can never escape.

777
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:55,975
No...

778
00:40:56,976 --> 00:40:58,978
No.

779
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,287
Not so fast, Lena,
I'm gonna get you.

780
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,551
I got you.

781
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:16,299
Oh, no, no.

782
00:41:16,343 --> 00:41:17,823
I found it, Mother.

783
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,004
End simulation.

784
00:41:27,049 --> 00:41:30,488
Ms. Luthor, preliminary tests
confirm any properties

785
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,968
the medallion may have had
are gone.

786
00:41:33,012 --> 00:41:36,145
Doesn't matter,
can you translate
these markings?

787
00:41:45,198 --> 00:41:47,679
Now access the memories
of Eve Tessmacher

788
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,159
and tell me everything
she knows about Leviathan.
