1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,224
What do you think
it's gonna do?

2
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,574
Whoa!

3
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,714
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

4
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:32,380
End simulation.

5
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,775
-End simulation.

6
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,695
End simulation!

7
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,219
End simulation!

8
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,880
Why didn't you end simulation?

9
00:00:54,924 --> 00:00:57,535
Yeah, I tried. It didn't work.

10
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,537
And the failsafe button?

11
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:02,888
What, you mean that giant
red thing that screams
"Push me"?

12
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:06,196
It's tied to your biometrics.
It appears when necessary.

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,285
Yeah, it disappeared
the minute I reached for it.

14
00:01:09,286 --> 00:01:11,201
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

15
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,725
your failsafe failed.

16
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,728
Really? This is the first time
that I've ever encountered it,

17
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:21,255
but your experience will be
reported to our
development team, Mr. Bates.

18
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:24,214
I assure you,
this glitch will be fixed.

19
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:27,217
Long before the launch of
Obsidian Platinum.

20
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,264
I can handle his exit interview
from here, Ms. Olsen.

21
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,805
Dreamer,
I'm sending him to you.

22
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,506
Nap time.

23
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:03,166
That was incredible!

24
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,777
You beat my record
for defeating a Dominator.

25
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:07,779
Well, you warmed him up
for me.

26
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:10,130
Don't you have a date
to get to?

27
00:02:10,173 --> 00:02:12,784
Go! Get out of here.
I want pictures.

28
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:21,489
Close off the street.
Secure the area.

29
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,496
You're welcome...

30
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:30,802
Director Dox.

31
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,369
Thank you, Dreamer.

32
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:34,893
Yes, um...

33
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,461
Thank you.

34
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,028
You already said that.

35
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,693
Hey. What's the emergency?

36
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:53,303
Blue or purple?

37
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,566
-Oh, your date with
William is tonight.
-Yes.

38
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,351
-Cancel it for me?
-No, I will not.

39
00:02:57,394 --> 00:02:59,701
And, blue. Always go with
the blue. You know this.

40
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,572
I know. I know. But, I...

41
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,705
It's been two and a half years
since I went on a date.

42
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,663
What if I...

43
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,361
forgot how to do it?

44
00:03:07,404 --> 00:03:09,667
You smile, and you laugh,
and your reach for the check.

45
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:11,930
You make it sound
so easy.

46
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:14,672
But the way, you should have
seen Nia today.
She was on fire.

47
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:17,240
Yeah, I did.
She was all over YouTube

48
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,677
and the news,
and every other platform
I've never hear of.

49
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,853
I'm just so proud of her.

50
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:25,205
And you know what, it just
feels so good to know that if
I want to take a night off,

51
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,381
three's someone there
that can save the day.

52
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:30,688
After a productive dinner
with Crown Prince
Raakaan el-Farah,

53
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,951
philanthropist Lex Luthor
announced

54
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,390
that Obsidian Platinum's
VR lenses will soon
be available in Quarac.

55
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,739
Gross.

56
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,394
Well, don't book your trip
to Bali just yet,

57
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,700
-we still have to deal
with Lex.
-And we will.

58
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:45,355
We will stop him
and get him out of the DEO

59
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,792
and we'll get you back in there
where you belong.

60
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:50,360
You miss it, don't you?

61
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,797
Well, I mean,
I like to think that
the DEO misses me.

62
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:57,280
But, yeah. Yeah, I miss it.

63
00:03:57,324 --> 00:04:00,283
But, hey, you know what,
I am blazing
a whole new trail here,

64
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:04,548
and tonight I will be
having a date with this guy.

65
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,377
Oh! Oh, is that,
that Martian weapon
J'onn gave you?

66
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,379
-What do you call it,
the Hand of the Solider?
-Yeah.

67
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:10,250
How's training?

68
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:12,600
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

69
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:15,255
-Right?
-Mmm-hmm.

70
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,301
-Ow! God, this...

71
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,262
This thing is supposed to know
what I'm thinking,

72
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:23,741
but it's being
very stubborn.

73
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,570
Well, like soldier like hand.

74
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,572
- Don't scare me!

75
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,666
Isn't that Dreamer
something amazing?

76
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,625
I think she's more powerful
than Supergirl.

77
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,715
I don't know. I think she
probably has her problems
just like everyone else.

78
00:04:41,846 --> 00:04:43,674
Oh, no.

79
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,763
You are not spending
another Friday night

80
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:48,288
on this couch, in sweats
housing rocky road.

81
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,811
I like ice cream.

82
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,029
Nia.

83
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:53,423
Sweet little Nia,

84
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:55,817
you are becoming a...
what's the word?

85
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,948
Loser.

86
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,211
And you're young,
you're vibrant,

87
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:02,127
but if you sit on this couch,
crying over that weird little
man for one more minute,

88
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,955
you gonna develop
permanent mope face.

89
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,480
I am not moping over...

90
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,656
Barney. I just had
a long day.

91
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,311
So, you need
an even longer night.
Come on.

92
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,225
You going out with me.

93
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,010
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at the club, and
I want you to meet him too.

94
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:17,882
Wait. I didn't know you were
seeing anyone.
Where'd you meet him?

95
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,145
We've been together
for three weeks.

96
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,582
And we met on Upswipz.

97
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:24,367
Yvette.

98
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,370
"Loves sunsets,

99
00:05:27,414 --> 00:05:31,156
yachting, and hanging out
with my BFF Dreamer?"

100
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,725
How often do you hang out
with your "BFF Dreamer?"

101
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,988
She waved at me once.
That counts as a hey.

102
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,513
Besides, everybody
embellishes on those things.

103
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,950
-It's Angus.

104
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,911
He says
he cannot wait to meet me.

105
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,000
Wait, you haven't met him yet?

106
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,351
Well, not physically,
but emotionally, it's like
we've been together forever.

107
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:52,613
Now get dressed.

108
00:05:55,964 --> 00:05:58,749
Okay... all right.

109
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:01,926
-So, you've never
played 8-Ball?
-What!

110
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,581
Are you kidding me?
I'm from Midvale.

111
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,888
-We have pool halls
on every corner, okay?
-Okay?

112
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,281
Okay, fine.

113
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,588
Maybe I've only played it
once in my life.

114
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,374
Okay, well, then we'll take it
one shot at a time.

115
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,505
For you.

116
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,246
Oh, 'cause you're such
a pool shark?

117
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,769
Oh, yeah. I'm not that bad.

118
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:20,249
All right.

119
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:22,382
All right.

120
00:06:22,425 --> 00:06:27,604
Let's just take it nice
and soft.

121
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,134
-Beginner's luck?

122
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:50,105
Ooh! I can't wait to dance
with my man.

123
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:55,458
I have to go to
the bathroom.

124
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:58,287
Don't take too long,
Angus will be here any minute.

125
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,642
You know, I was gonna ask
if I can buy you a drink,
but I assume Angus

126
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:07,731
has already spoken for you?

127
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,647
He sure has.
Loud and clear.

128
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,736
And I just missed
a text message from him.

129
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,609
Ah, he wants me
to meet him outside.
Excuse me.

130
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:21,832
Angus?

131
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,666
An...

132
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,496
-You leaving early tonight?
-Yeah.

133
00:07:35,237 --> 00:07:38,370
That place is way too crowded.

134
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:41,286
-Did you find your boyfriend?
-No, he'll be here in a minute.

135
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,374
Oh.

136
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,813
He should have suggested that
you meet at sunset.

137
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,642
What?

138
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:52,297
You favorite time of day...
is on a yacht

139
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,473
at sunset.

140
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:59,000
At least that's what
you told me
in our first Upswipz chat.

141
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,828
And I don't think
you'd lie to me.

142
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,222
Would you do that?

143
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,447
Yvette?

144
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,189
Are you okay?

145
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,366
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

146
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,324
Angus.

147
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:21,152
Your boyfriend did this to you?

148
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:23,024
He only pretended to like me.

149
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,809
He targeted me

150
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:28,333
so I can give this message
to Dreamer.

151
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,341
"The world doesn't want
a trans superhero.

152
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:39,997
So crawl back under
the rock you came from...

153
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,914
came from, or I'll keep
attacking people like you."

154
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:57,014
Our profiler put together
this sketch

155
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,364
based on your statement.

156
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:00,627
Is this the guy?

157
00:09:01,715 --> 00:09:05,022
-Yeah, that's him.
-Thank you.

158
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:08,548
Now, we're still going over
security footage, and
questioning other patrons

159
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,593
but, please,

160
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:14,554
do not hesitate to call
if you remember anything
that may help us.

161
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,642
Okay?

162
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,948
I'll show you out.

163
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:22,344
I'm gonna go lie down.

164
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,434
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

165
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,917
Nia? Nia?
Nia, thank goodness.

166
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:31,962
Are you okay?

167
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,617
Is Yvette?

168
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,793
Why didn't you call me
last night?

169
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,927
-I would have been there--
-Yvette wanted to be alone.

170
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,452
She's not just hurt
and humiliated,
she's heartbroken.

171
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:48,152
She thought this guy
really liked her.

172
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,502
And he was just targeting her
because she was trans.

173
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,549
He was trying to use her
to get to Dreamer.

174
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,073
What did he want with Dreamer?

175
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:58,119
He wants me to stop
being a superhero.

176
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,645
He's going after my community
to bully me into it.

177
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:05,735
Listen to me, Nia, listen.
We will find this guy.

178
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,650
Yeah, we will.

179
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,653
And when we do,
I'll bury him.

180
00:10:10,697 --> 00:10:11,785
Nia?

181
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,483
Look, I...

182
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:17,312
I know this is
a personal attack,

183
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:21,098
but you have to trust that
when we find this guy the cops
are gonna put him behind bars.

184
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:25,450
Kara, I love you, but do not
tell me what I can
and can't do right now.

185
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:29,324
There is no catching this guy
and redeeming him.

186
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:32,632
There is no hope speech
that can make this better.

187
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,763
-Nia...
-No.

188
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,983
Look, my community
is vulnerable.

189
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,683
This happens more than
you could possibly know.

190
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:44,121
And there are guys just like
this jerk out there

191
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:46,471
who want to hurt us.

192
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:49,561
They want us to hide
and to be afraid

193
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,867
to be who we are.

194
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:54,131
They wants us to disappear,
and it happens...

195
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:56,307
-every day.
-I know,

196
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:59,354
and what this guy did
is horrible--

197
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,139
He's not the first,
and he won't be the last.

198
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,664
And we haven't exactly been
a priority for the cops.

199
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:08,755
So, just trust me when I say
that I am the one
protecting this community.

200
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:12,715
And now this bastard
is going after

201
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,065
my community,
trying to erase me?

202
00:11:16,023 --> 00:11:17,328
No.

203
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,200
No, this guy is over.

204
00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:27,338
Look, I know that
you're hurting right now,

205
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:30,515
and I will never
fully understand.

206
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,082
But, between us and the cops,

207
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:34,694
we will make sure
justice is served.

208
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:36,391
Nia?

209
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:38,959
Just give us a chance.

210
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:43,050
Fine.

211
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,922
A few hours.

212
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,100
But then,
I'm doing this my way.

213
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,074
I said shield!

214
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:13,210
Alex, the Martian DNA
in your weapon

215
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:15,778
will code itself to your
bio-electric pulses

216
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:17,911
allowing you to morph it
with a single thought.

217
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,869
But you have to let it in.

218
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:21,871
Yeah. Okay, Ollivander.

219
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:24,091
Is there any kind of
instruction manual
for this thing?

220
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,049
I'm afraid not.
It's instinctual.

221
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:28,051
Trust the weapon,
and it will trust you.

222
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:31,489
How am I supposed to trust this
if it keeps changing on me?

223
00:12:34,144 --> 00:12:37,060
All right. Look,
I know things have been
difficult for you

224
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,583
since leaving the DEO.

225
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,672
Life can be challenging
when there's no clear path.

226
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,413
Oh, no, no.
I have a clear path.

227
00:12:42,457 --> 00:12:45,895
Okay, it's stop Lex Luthor
from traipsing around the world

228
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:48,637
just cashing in on the goodwill
that he never earned,

229
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,204
and get my life back.

230
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,597
Now, let's do it again.

231
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,469
-What is that?

232
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:57,646
J'onn, Alex, thanks for
seeing me this late.

233
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:59,169
No problem, Al.

234
00:13:00,954 --> 00:13:02,520
My brother Trevor's missing.

235
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,827
He lives in my basement, but

236
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,437
I haven't seen him
for about a week.

237
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,917
Did you file a police report?

238
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:11,660
I did... but then the cops
found this on his computer.

239
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:18,014
An invitation
to a weekend
escape experience

240
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,451
at Obsidian Platinum's
Virtual Las Vegas.

241
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,845
Invite says to get
a hotel room.

242
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:26,196
So, no disturbances could
pull the players away from
their virtual experience.

243
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,113
So the cops don't think that
he's missing. They think that
he's in some VR party binge.

244
00:13:30,157 --> 00:13:32,637
Right. But that was a week ago.

245
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:35,118
Look, I'm telling you
this is not like Trevor at all.

246
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,816
Al, do you mind taking me
to your house?

247
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,861
I'd like to take a look around,
see what I can find.

248
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:42,299
And Kelly works for
Obsidian North, so she can
get me into Virtual Vegas.

249
00:13:42,343 --> 00:13:44,824
And if there's a chance
that Trevor is in there,

250
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:48,044
then I will find him,
and he can tell me
where he is in the real world.

251
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:49,741
I really appreciate this.

252
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,178
Hey, no problem, Al.

253
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,762
Kara Danvers.

254
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:12,677
I hope this is important,
I'm very busy.

255
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:15,158
It is. It's about...

256
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,986
-Dreamer.
-Yes.

257
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,423
I just saw the coverage
of her victory over
the Dominator.

258
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:22,600
No, it's not that.
She needs our help.

259
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,690
There's an attacker targeting
the trans community

260
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:27,257
trying to get Dreamer
to take her cape off.

261
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,433
That's awful.

262
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:35,396
I mean... it is only logical
that violence begets concern.

263
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,399
Listen, I know
this guy's human,
but can you help me track him?

264
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,749
Consider it done.

265
00:14:43,752 --> 00:14:47,234
So, the last thing that Al
knows is that his brother
checked himself in

266
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,366
to some hotel who knows where,

267
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:52,761
and that he met up with
some friends at a place
called the Escape Palace?

268
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:55,720
Yeah, located somewhere
in Virtual Las Vegas.

269
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,940
We figured that Trevor
must have paid cash
for his room,

270
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:00,464
because there's no paper trail
of him anywhere.

271
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:03,903
So, I was thinking maybe
I could go into
Virtual Las Vegas, and just

272
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,209
-see what I could find.
-Okay.

273
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:09,821
Now, these lenses
are very different
than the original.

274
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,475
Okay?

275
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,043
Obsidian Platinum doesn't just
utilize the brain link,

276
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,827
it connects to your biology.

277
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,568
Which means what exactly?

278
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:21,050
So, in this version,
you're not just
seeing virtual reality,

279
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,443
you're feeling it.

280
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:25,402
Cold will feel cold,
hot will feel hot,

281
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,100
everything will feel real.

282
00:15:27,143 --> 00:15:31,060
So, once you're in,
you'll be in,
what looks like a lobby.

283
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,584
There you will select
your desired experience.

284
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,283
You will see a panel
of virtual options,

285
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:38,763
mined from your own
thoughts and desires.

286
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,983
Virtual Las Vegas
is one of these.

287
00:15:41,027 --> 00:15:43,246
Okay, so what happens
when I get inside?

288
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,900
What are the rules?

289
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,121
That's the difference between
reality, and virtual reality.

290
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,819
Inside Obsidian Platinum
there are no rules.

291
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:53,343
Great. Sounds easy.

292
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,172
You'll get the hang of it.
I promise.

293
00:15:56,216 --> 00:16:00,785
Just remember, if you need
to come out, say
"End simulation."

294
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:02,657
And if, for some reason,

295
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,138
it gets too intense in there
and you can't say that,

296
00:16:05,181 --> 00:16:07,270
the program will launch
your failsafe button.

297
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,532
You can't miss it.

298
00:16:08,576 --> 00:16:10,099
Just touch it,
and you will be pulled out.

299
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,971
And I'll be able
to communicate with you?

300
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,146
The whole time.

301
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:16,149
Okay, well...

302
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,151
bottom's up.

303
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,634
I'm in.

304
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:26,724
Good. You should see
your experience options.

305
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:30,032
Yeah, I do.

306
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,777
Did you find Virtual Las Vegas?

307
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,607
Yeah, I got it.
Hang on.

308
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:45,482
There it is.

309
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:46,701
Vegas, baby...

310
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,530
Vegas.

311
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:03,152
Well, I know where I can go
to find the Siegfried and Roy
interactive experience.

312
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:04,936
No, thank you, but

313
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,590
where am I gonna find
this Escape House?

314
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,505
Talk to
the users inside.

315
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:10,594
Someone must know
where it is.

316
00:17:10,638 --> 00:17:13,162
But stay away from the people
with three lines
on their necks,

317
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:15,512
-those are NPCs.
-What ae NPCs?

318
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:17,601
Non-Player Characters.

319
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,255
AIs who populate the world,

320
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,865
not actual users.

321
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,650
-They won't know much.
-Okay.

322
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:31,920
He said he
was meeting with some
virtual friends in VR?

323
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,878
Yeah, but I don't know
who they are.

324
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:36,185
I don't even know
their avatar names.

325
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:37,752
Well, let's see
what we can find.

326
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:44,715
I just don't understand.
When Trevor and I first came
to this planet together,

327
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,543
we were inseparable.

328
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,371
But, for the last few months,

329
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:50,373
all he does
is retreat into VR.

330
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,811
What is it?

331
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:57,641
I managed to track down the
user names of two of Trevor's
virtual friends.

332
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,556
We can get these to Kelly
at Obsidian North,

333
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,558
maybe she can help us
find out who they are.

334
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,778
That way maybe we could
maybe find Trevor.

335
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:07,216
Look, Al, do you have
anything personal of Trevor's?

336
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,001
Something with an emotional
connection that
I could maybe use

337
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,481
to psychically trace him.

338
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,620
I gave this to Trevor
to mark our first year
on Earth.

339
00:18:21,187 --> 00:18:22,536
He wore it every day.

340
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:25,626
Till he switched to
a smart watch.

341
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:28,324
Thanks, man.

342
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,674
Hey, look,
we're gonna find him.

343
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,426
Oh.

344
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,602
Hey, you think
real Vegas buffets
are intense,

345
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,953
you need to try the
all you can eat to get you to
he perfect state of fullness.

346
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,781
No matter how much you eat,
you feel great.

347
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,306
I'll keep that in mind
for the next time. Thank you.

348
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,135
You wouldn't happen to know
where I can find a place called

349
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,484
the Escape Palace, do you?

350
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,007
Escape Palace?

351
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,357
You mean that
spooky looking joint
up on the hill?

352
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,446
Ridiculous add-on
if you ask me.

353
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,796
They don't have hills like that
in the desert.

354
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,364
Right, uh... thanks.

355
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,714
-Sure thing, kid.
- Hey, blue eyes,
bring me the lobster.

356
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,238
So many calories.

357
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,065
He's right. That house is a recent add-on,

358
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,328
customized by a user.

359
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:16,938
Okay, so what does that mean?

360
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,158
Advanced users can
customize the virtual world,

361
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,813
but it takes time to catalogue these additions in our system.

362
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:24,859
-So, I don't know what
we can expect.

363
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,775
Well, if Trevor's in there,
then I gotta check it out.

364
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,560
I'm going in.

365
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:33,868
-I don't like this.

366
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,134
Oh, my God.

367
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,704
This is just like when
Rick Malverne tried
to drown me.

368
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:53,235
Okay, the user who created
this palace

369
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,716
designed it to tap into
a player's worst fears.

370
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,197
That makes the experience
different for everyone.

371
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,763
And harder to escape.

372
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:02,201
But, this isn't real,

373
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,767
there's nothing to be
afraid of.

374
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,856
Help. We've been trapped
for days.

375
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,249
Wait, you can talk?

376
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,077
End your simulation.

377
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,253
I can't.

378
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,776
It's part of the game.

379
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,604
Then the failsafe disappeared.

380
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,867
What? I reported that glitch
months ago.

381
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:18,347
Somebody must have hacked it.

382
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,654
Alex, you need to get them
out of there.

383
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:23,222
If they've been tortured
for days, there could be
serious repercussions.

384
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,049
I thought you said
this wasn't real?

385
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,704
But they think it is,
and with Obsidian Platinum,

386
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,533
it feels real.
This is why we have a failsafe.

387
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:32,535
-It's encoded
with a biometric--
-Okay, Kelly,

388
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,668
just in English.
What are you saying?

389
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:38,237
If you don't break through
those tanks right now,
they could suffer brain damage.

390
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,194
Okay.

391
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,591
All right.

392
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:54,731
- You did it.

393
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,821
Okay, now give me the names
and locations, so I can send
teams in to eject them.

394
00:20:57,865 --> 00:20:59,562
Tell your teams to hurry.

395
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:02,478
On it. I'm gonna figure out
why the failsafe
didn't trigger.

396
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,741
Listen, I'm gonna
get you guys out of here.

397
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,266
But we're looking for a man
named Trevor Crane.

398
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,268
Have you seen him in here?

399
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,661
Trevor's done a bunch
of escape rooms with us.

400
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:14,447
He and the new guy Richard

401
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,492
solved the puzzle quickly
and made it through,

402
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,146
but that door slammed shut.

403
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:23,499
We were about to follow
when spiders suddenly started
crawling all over me.

404
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:24,935
And I hate spiders.

405
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,198
Whose idea was it to come
to this escape experience?

406
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:29,200
It was Richard's.

407
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,507
How well do you know him?

408
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,466
He's new to the group.

409
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:36,947
I need to get to him
before it's too late.

410
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:41,169
So, you're saying this
Richard person intentionally
dropped Trevor in VR?

411
00:21:41,212 --> 00:21:42,431
It looks that way.

412
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,215
He's figured out
a glitch in the system

413
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,435
that prevents people from
safely ejecting.

414
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:49,743
Well, I followed the psychic
trail from Trevor's watch to
a house outside Opal City.

415
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,485
I'll let you know
what I find out.

416
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:57,751
Excuse me.

417
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,668
-Can I help you?
-I hope you can.

418
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:23,037
Hi, Detective Rivers,
it's Nia Nal.

419
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,344
I wanted to see if there
was any updates on
Yvette's assault.

420
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,651
We're still reviewing
surveillance footage from the
club and surrounding businesses

421
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:31,219
and processing
the physical evidence.

422
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,352
So, you're saying
you're nowhere?

423
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:37,051
I can assure you,
I will do everything in
my power to catch him.

424
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,880
I appreciate that.

425
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:45,451
I gave you your chance.

426
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,584
Sorry, Kara.

427
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:53,546
Now it's time to do
everything in my power.

428
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:00,074
Come and get me.

429
00:23:03,904 --> 00:23:08,212
Mrs. Bates, are you sure
you don't know Trevor Crane?

430
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:10,519
A number of leads
have led me to this address.

431
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:12,391
Perhaps he's using an alias?

432
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:15,045
No. Sorry.

433
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:16,525
Could he be a friend
of your spouse's?

434
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,572
No, I don't think I've
ever heard Richard mention him.

435
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,835
-Your husband's name
is Richard?
-Yes.

436
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:28,232
Jennifer, I'm gonna need you
to stop lying to me.

437
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:31,235
Right now, Trevor is trapped
in a high-level
virtual reality experience

438
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,889
by a man named Richard.

439
00:23:32,933 --> 00:23:35,631
-Possibly being tortured.
-But that's not possible.

440
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,938
-So, you do know him?
-Yes.

441
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,244
Kind of.

442
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,595
We've been spending
some time together in VR.

443
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,248
-Like an affair?
-No.

444
00:23:44,292 --> 00:23:46,120
I have never met him
in real life.

445
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,602
It's just harmless fun.

446
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,778
Does your husband know
about this...

447
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,606
harmless fun?

448
00:23:56,783 --> 00:24:00,047
My husband can be a little...

449
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,791
possessive.

450
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:07,489
So, I do my thing in VR,
and he does his.

451
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,926
He's a computer engineer
in love with all
the technical details,

452
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,885
and me, I just want to

453
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,757
escape for a few hours.

454
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:18,979
Regardless, I need to
find Trevor and your husband
as soon as possible.

455
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,198
Or they could both suffer
permanent damage.

456
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,205
Director Dox?

457
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:32,949
I found over 200
social media groups,
and message boards,

458
00:24:32,993 --> 00:24:34,516
all catering to
trans hate groups.

459
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,257
-They're on this drive.
-Thank you.

460
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,523
That will be all.

461
00:24:58,845 --> 00:25:01,891
-It's no use.
-J'onn located Richard's wife.

462
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:03,806
Richard's a
computer programmer.

463
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,549
We think that he made
the escape experience
as a way to trap Trevor

464
00:25:07,593 --> 00:25:10,509
because Trevor was having
a virtual affair with
Richard's wife.

465
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:11,988
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

466
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:14,382
I know, and I need to have
a conversation with Andrea

467
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:17,690
-about unintended uses
of Obsidian Platinum.
-All right.

468
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,257
Now, any ideas of how
I can get through this door?

469
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:23,826
If you concentrate hard enough,
you can override
Richard's program.

470
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,220
Bend it to your will,
not his.

471
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:32,879
-I did it.

472
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,587
Kelly?

473
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,068
It is totally different
in here.

474
00:25:49,504 --> 00:25:51,288
Kelly?

475
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:53,769
-Can you hear me?
-Alex?

476
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:55,336
Alex, are you there?

477
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,513
This shouldn't be possible,

478
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,950
but it looks like Richard
customized the room to block
remote monitoring.

479
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:02,256
Hello?

480
00:26:03,823 --> 00:26:04,998
Trevor?

481
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,087
Okay.

482
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,568
I'm going in.

483
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,663
Maybe put Yvette's quote
at the top of the third graph.

484
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,534
Brilliant.

485
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:25,758
"Over 24 trans people have been
murdered in this country
in the past year."

486
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:29,152
The true number's
likely much higher.

487
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,111
Many of these attacks
go mis-reported

488
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,287
because victims are
misgendered in police reports.

489
00:26:34,288 --> 00:26:36,638
Nia was so angry.

490
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:39,293
I get it,
this is so frustrating.

491
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,469
I wish we could
do more to help.

492
00:26:43,993 --> 00:26:45,516
Hang on.

493
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:47,997
Brainy, what's up?

494
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:51,087
I'm sending you
an Upswipz profile Nia created.

495
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,263
It appears she's trying to
lure out Yvette's attacker

496
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:54,700
by using herself as bait.

497
00:26:57,964 --> 00:27:00,314
I'll talk to her,
and, Brainy,

498
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,663
thank you.

499
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,277
So, something came up,

500
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,497
-would you mind...
-Covering for you?

501
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,541
Of course.

502
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,900
You wanted Dreamer,

503
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:23,990
well, now you've got her.

504
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,177
Trevor Crane?

505
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,398
I'm Alex Danvers.

506
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:44,314
Your brother sent me.

507
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:46,534
Oh, thank God.

508
00:27:47,753 --> 00:27:49,015
It's happening again.

509
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:51,495
Stay back!

510
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:52,366
What?

511
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,152
Please make it stop!

512
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,546
Okay, I don't understand,
just talk to me.

513
00:27:58,589 --> 00:27:59,721
-Trevor?

514
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,552
What the hell just happened?

515
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,772
I don't know.

516
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:10,166
At first, I thought
I was standing on
some kind of a land mine.

517
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,994
If I take a step,
I explode, but

518
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,431
standing still doesn't
work either. I still blow up.

519
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,042
It's random.

520
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:17,260
And the pain...

521
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:21,874
-it's horrible.
-Okay, just... focus.

522
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,266
Okay, where is Richard?

523
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,920
I don't know.

524
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,531
I think he planned
this whole thing.

525
00:28:27,575 --> 00:28:30,883
Sometimes he shows up
just to watch me explode.

526
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,015
-It's happening again.
-No, you can fight this.

527
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:34,582
-You just have to--
-Look out.

528
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:44,070
End your simulation.

529
00:28:44,113 --> 00:28:46,637
-I am not leaving here
without Trevor.
-Yeah?

530
00:28:47,638 --> 00:28:49,771
Okay, well, then
I'm gonna show you

531
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,164
how real this can be.

532
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,123
'Cause this is my house!

533
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,083
And this is my gun.

534
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:05,787
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

535
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,621
Easy, tiger.

536
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:17,930
Are you okay?

537
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,764
Get back.
I can't control it.

538
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,678
No, no, I'm not going anywhere.

539
00:29:27,722 --> 00:29:31,291
And you can control this,
Trevor. You need to
will it to stop.

540
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:32,945
All right,
you make the rules now.

541
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:35,295
Come on.

542
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,472
That's it.

543
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,517
That's it.
You got this.

544
00:29:44,957 --> 00:29:47,437
-It worked.
-Yeah.

545
00:29:47,481 --> 00:29:50,440
-You were right.
-I knew you could do it.

546
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,791
All right, listen to me.
Give me your location.

547
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,183
I will go out
and I will get help.

548
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,359
I'm at the National City Grand.

549
00:29:56,403 --> 00:29:59,580
-Room 315.
-Okay, you just hang on
and you try to stay calm.

550
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:01,712
End simulation.

551
00:30:05,151 --> 00:30:06,935
Alex, I couldn't reach you.
What happened in there?

552
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,677
I just fought Richard,
blasted him clean out of VR.

553
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,853
But how?
That shouldn't be possible.

554
00:30:11,897 --> 00:30:13,637
We'll figure that out later.

555
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:15,030
I found Trevor.

556
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:16,989
I'm gonna call J'onn
and give him his address.

557
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:21,645
No, I'll get him.

558
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:24,344
But I need you to send
a paramedics to
the Coastline Motel.

559
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:26,520
Room 10.

560
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,835
-Looking for me?

561
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:39,838
You weren't supposed
to be here.

562
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,495
Got something you wanna say?

563
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,714
Yeah.

564
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,501
I don't think

565
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,590
you're the right kind
of role model.

566
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:56,332
-That's not for you
to decide.
-Well,

567
00:30:56,376 --> 00:30:58,508
somebody has to stand up
to you people.

568
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:02,338
You stand up by hiding behind
a fake name online?

569
00:31:02,382 --> 00:31:04,123
And by attacking
innocent people?

570
00:31:06,647 --> 00:31:07,866
It worked, didn't it?

571
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:27,015
-You make me sick.
-No, you make me sick,

572
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:28,451
you twisted freak!

573
00:31:28,495 --> 00:31:30,540
You show up on the scene
one day tricking dudes

574
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,760
into thinking that
you're this hot new superhero.

575
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,370
The girl next door,

576
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:37,417
but heroes are supposed to
be virtuous,

577
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,549
and honest, and here you are

578
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:40,594
lying!

579
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:43,814
I get it.

580
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:47,775
Your fragile ego
was just shattered.

581
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:50,256
Your sense of self
is so shaky,

582
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,086
that anything outside
your narrow world view
threatens it.

583
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:57,393
Dreamer, don't.

584
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:59,918
Stay out of this.
This is my fight!

585
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,920
And you won.
Look at him.

586
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:06,489
Don't let him turn you
into something you're not.

587
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:08,709
Why should he get to live?

588
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:12,756
If you do this, you will take
a piece of his darkness and
carry it with you forever.

589
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,977
When you put that suit on,
you became a symbol.

590
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:19,241
You give people hope.
Don't let them down

591
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,765
by stooping to his level.

592
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:23,985
Now, please, let's just
turn him in

593
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,639
and make sure
he faces justice.

594
00:32:25,682 --> 00:32:27,336
You can't promise
that'll happen.

595
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,642
No, I can't.

596
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,299
And I understand...

597
00:32:33,342 --> 00:32:35,997
You feel like you're
the only one protecting
your community,

598
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,520
but you're not alone.

599
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:40,132
You have me.

600
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,832
And Alex and J'onn and, yes,

601
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:47,008
even Brainy
in his heart of hearts.

602
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:49,880
And maybe we all
should have opened
our eyes to the realities

603
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:51,839
that your and your community
face every day.

604
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:54,015
But now we have.

605
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:56,626
And now we will all have
our eyes open

606
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,976
for people like him.

607
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,814
You are going to prison

608
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:14,122
-for a long time.

609
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,994
And when you're out,

610
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,474
I will be watching you.

611
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:20,824
And if you ever

612
00:33:20,868 --> 00:33:24,828
make a move against anyone
in my community again,

613
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:26,569
I will give you a nightmare

614
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:30,356
you will never
wake up from.

615
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:50,898
Nia?

616
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:55,033
Hey. Hey. It's okay.

617
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,905
Kara, I almost murdered
someone tonight...

618
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,865
and I still
kind of want to.

619
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,215
I know.

620
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:05,217
I don't wanna be a killer,
but...

621
00:34:08,307 --> 00:34:10,222
Kara, I'm not okay.

622
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:15,357
I am so overwhelmed.

623
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:18,099
And this guy
just triggered everything.

624
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:22,799
I had a dream flash

625
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:29,545
right before Yvette
was attacked and
I couldn't interpret it.

626
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,809
I couldn't save Yvette,
just like I couldn't
save my mom.

627
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:35,073
I couldn't stop that guy
and my

628
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,118
powers are mixed up

629
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:38,946
and unpredictable!
And I...

630
00:34:39,512 --> 00:34:41,079
And the one person

631
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,125
who supported me
from day one,

632
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:46,910
who was always by my side,

633
00:34:46,954 --> 00:34:48,956
who saw me
for who I am, and...

634
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:54,962
looked at me like
I was beautiful.

635
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,616
It just broke my heart.

636
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,141
And I don't even know why.

637
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,492
I wish I had answers for you.

638
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:05,364
I'm so sorry.

639
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:19,856
When that bastard
attacked my community,

640
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,296
the one thing
it felt like I had left...

641
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:27,777
I snapped.

642
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,780
At least this was something
I could control.

643
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:34,784
I could find this guy
and stop him.

644
00:35:34,828 --> 00:35:36,612
Permanently.

645
00:35:36,656 --> 00:35:39,137
I could do something
to protect

646
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,009
someone.

647
00:35:42,052 --> 00:35:44,011
I felt that kind of
pressure before.

648
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,144
That anger...

649
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:50,800
but I wasn't looking at things
through your eyes

650
00:35:50,844 --> 00:35:52,541
and your experiences...

651
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:55,501
And I'm so sorry.

652
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,287
And I know, I know,

653
00:35:59,331 --> 00:36:04,205
sometimes
being the good guy sucks.

654
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:07,687
Especially when you know
how easy it would be
to just get rid of

655
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,429
someone so vile
and full of hate.

656
00:36:12,126 --> 00:36:13,258
But, hey,

657
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,000
not doing that...

658
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:20,178
that is what makes us
different from them.

659
00:36:21,701 --> 00:36:24,007
That's what let's us
keep protecting people,

660
00:36:24,051 --> 00:36:26,836
and your community needs you.

661
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,577
They need Dreamer.

662
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,714
And I'm so sorry. I didn't know
how much pain you were in.

663
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:38,065
-Oh!

664
00:36:42,374 --> 00:36:44,724
Okay,
relationship talk.

665
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:48,031
Let's decide right now
that any virtual romance
is cheating.

666
00:36:48,075 --> 00:36:49,511
-Deal.
-Yeah.

667
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:52,210
Also, virtual torture,

668
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,690
that is definitely real
attempted murder.

669
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:58,259
Yeah. There are a lot
of open questions

670
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:01,915
about ethics and morality
in the virtual world.

671
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,178
You okay?

672
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,922
I do truly believe that
what we're...

673
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:12,099
What I am doing at
Obsidian North can help people.

674
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,885
I just, I feel so guilty

675
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:21,151
and angry that someone would
take advantage of our
technology like that.

676
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:23,066
Use our tools as a weapon?

677
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,939
Maybe there should be some
regulations on who can use
Obsidian Platinum.

678
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:27,636
I agree.

679
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,074
But I flagged that glitch
months ago,

680
00:37:31,118 --> 00:37:33,207
and I was promised that
it was taken care of.

681
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,779
Alex?

682
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:42,608
Trevor.

683
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:45,001
Hey, it's...

684
00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:46,612
It's so good to see you out.

685
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:49,136
I'm so glad that you're okay.

686
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:51,312
I really wanted to meet you

687
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:53,880
in the real world,
to thank you.

688
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:56,883
You saved my life.

689
00:37:58,667 --> 00:37:59,886
Wanna have a drink?

690
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:02,018
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

691
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:03,150
-This is Kelly.
-Hi.

692
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:04,978
-Hi.
-She's kind of
part of it, too.

693
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:18,470
We don't have to worry
about that creep anymore.

694
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:20,254
He's going to prison
for a long time.

695
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,434
What are you doing?

696
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,610
Deleting my Upswipz account.

697
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:30,612
And all social media accounts.

698
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,135
Yvette, you can't do that.

699
00:38:32,179 --> 00:38:35,443
I have had it
with putting myself out there.

700
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,880
Making myself an easy target.
I'm done.

701
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,708
He was just one bad person.

702
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:41,493
You can
tell yourself that, Nia,

703
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:42,494
like I did,

704
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,366
but I should have known better.

705
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:49,152
I'm a trans woman of color.

706
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,676
Okay, I know what
we're up against.

707
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:57,509
I wanted Angus
so badly to be real.

708
00:38:59,728 --> 00:39:03,210
For someone to care about me,
to get me, to adore me.

709
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,650
-It never got to be true.
-It will be.

710
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:11,697
You will find that kind
of love, Yvette, but not
if you shut down.

711
00:39:17,224 --> 00:39:19,357
They want us to be invisible...

712
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:23,230
because of their own fears.

713
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:26,364
They want to erase us

714
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,105
so we need to shine
even brighter.

715
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,371
You are a beautiful woman.

716
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,287
Big beautiful life,

717
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:41,291
and sharing that life
is what will change this world.

718
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:50,213
The bigot you arrested,
Gregory Bauer,

719
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:53,521
belongs to an online hate group
specifically targeting
the trans community.

720
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,741
I took the liberty
of identifying its users.

721
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:59,309
The group boasts about
future attacks and
takes credit for others.

722
00:39:59,353 --> 00:40:02,704
I believe you will find
some leads to
your cold cases in there.

723
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:05,228
I... I don't know
what to say.

724
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:09,276
The DEO takes threats
against our sister superheroes
very seriously.

725
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:15,935
Ready for another round?

726
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:19,895
Come on!

727
00:40:19,939 --> 00:40:22,463
I can make you do anything
in the virtual world!

728
00:40:22,507 --> 00:40:23,812
But that wasn't
your real weapon, Alex.

729
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:28,469
You have to give it time
to bond to you.

730
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:31,124
Let's do this again tomorrow.

731
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,432
J'onn, really?

732
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,394
Mom, hey.

733
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,701
What's wrong?

734
00:40:52,362 --> 00:40:53,451
Alex?

735
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,323
What is it?

736
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,022
Mom just called me.

737
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,634
They found Dad.

738
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,984
Jeremiah?

739
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,466
He's dead.

740
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,132
There you go, Mr. Bates,

741
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,091
you just rest easy.

742
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:27,267
I've got you now.
