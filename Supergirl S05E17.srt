1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:02,959
Previously onSupergirl...

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,135
With Obsidian Platinum,

3
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:08,834
you will never
have to choose between
your life and your dream.

4
00:00:08,878 --> 00:00:12,186
Ever since Luthor Corp
partnered with us,
the board has a new member.

5
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,665
He could lock in subscribers.

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,580
It's built to trap you.

7
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:17,756
You don't think
our users deserve a warning

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,541
that the lenses
might be problematic?

9
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,718
I need a full
diagnostic write-up
on the fail-safe error code.

10
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:24,111
Yes, Miss Rojas.

11
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,069
We'll always find you, Eve.

12
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,592
Leviathan is everywhere.

13
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,905
The shooter has been identified as Lex Luthor.

14
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:37,472
Officers responding.

15
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,691
He's been disarmed, but he's still on the premises.

16
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,695
I knew it was him.

17
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,266
That lady
on the ground
was gonna shoot us.

18
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,311
One by one.

19
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,140
And that's when
Mr. Luthor showed up.

20
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,925
He wrestled the gun from her.

21
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,188
It just went off.

22
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:03,063
You saved them, Mr. Luthor.

23
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:06,979
Thank you.

24
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,504
Wait a minute.

25
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:12,115
These people will all think
Lex saved them.

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,335
Wasn't Lex the one
who put 'em in here?

27
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,423
Apparently not.

28
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:18,165
Listen to this.

29
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,645
Amy Sapphire was right.

30
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:25,128
Technology is the greatest evil mankind has ever faced.

31
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:30,090
I will continue her work
by killing people
until the world wakes up

32
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,656
from its apathy.

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,445
She was an acolyte
of Amy Sapphire's.

34
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:40,709
She'd been kidnapping
Obsidian Platinum users
for weeks.

35
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,232
Took full responsibility.

36
00:01:42,276 --> 00:01:43,755
Thank you so much.

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,455
I was sure Lex was behind this.

38
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,021
Yeah. We all were.

39
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:50,414
I don't understand.

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:54,984
Lex...

41
00:01:55,637 --> 00:01:56,942
a real hero?

42
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:58,205
How could this be true?

43
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:16,701
It's so much more fun
making Superman
kill Superman.

44
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,181
You've got to get
Luthor out of your head, Kal.

45
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:26,581
Who are you?

46
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:28,713
I...

47
00:02:31,107 --> 00:02:32,152
hate...

48
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:35,720
Kryptonians.

49
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:42,597
Are you all right, sir?

50
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,426
That depends.

51
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,210
Am I dead?

52
00:02:47,254 --> 00:02:49,734
Heavens no, sir.

53
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,389
But I dare say
you're a bit hungover.

54
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:53,303
Coffee?

55
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:05,315
I saved the world.

56
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,578
It's all in a day's work
for you, isn't it, Mr. Luthor?

57
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,364
Why else would they
be awarding you

58
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,974
the Nobel Peace Prize?

59
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,586
Uh...

60
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,935
I didn't just save the world...

61
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,330
I made a new world.

62
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,566
Any chance you've seen
my darling sister around?

63
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,225
So, the Monitor
kept his word.

64
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:50,621
The pre-Nobel celebration
went so late...

65
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:53,189
Ms. Luthor decided
to spend the night.

66
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,673
Don't worry, Lena, this will
just extend your beauty sleep
for a few hours

67
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,283
while I handle
some family business.

68
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:01,937
Sweet dreams.

69
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,243
Make sure she ends up
in her own home.

70
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,293
Sugar, dear?

71
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,121
You're rather calm for a woman

72
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:15,255
who just learned
the entire multi-verse
has been obliterated.

73
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,779
You do understand
I'm not the son you raised?

74
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,476
Perfectly.

75
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,263
Would your Lillian
have been frightened
by world destruction?

76
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,178
If so, you've upgraded.

77
00:04:26,222 --> 00:04:28,442
-No sugar.
-That's my boy.

78
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,750
The past is the past.

79
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:35,100
Best to focus on the future.

80
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:39,409
In this world,
the Luthors are revered.

81
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:41,977
How do we maintain our status?

82
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,718
Well, of course,
the first order of business

83
00:04:43,761 --> 00:04:45,328
is finding
the Fortress of Solitude

84
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,809
-and destroying
the Kryptonians--
-Why?

85
00:04:47,852 --> 00:04:49,550
Supergirl is
your greatest ally.

86
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,856
Was, I'm afraid.

87
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,425
Supergirl will remember
the previous world
as vividly as I do.

88
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:56,948
Soon it will be war.

89
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:58,428
We need to be prepared.

90
00:04:58,472 --> 00:04:59,473
You, me, and Lena.

91
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,824
The Lena who killed you?
That Lena?

92
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:05,870
Well, you said she'll remember
your previous world, too.

93
00:05:05,914 --> 00:05:06,784
What's your point?

94
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,048
That you have
an inferiority complex

95
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:12,616
over a pair of hokey heroes
in blue tights.

96
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,183
If Supergirl sneezes too hard,

97
00:05:14,226 --> 00:05:15,750
it would split
this planet in half.

98
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,970
And yet, it was her friendship
with your sister

99
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:20,842
that spun you out.

100
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,323
Friendship and loyalty
to Supergirl was what prompted
Lena to kill me.

101
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:26,630
Your obsession with Kryptonians
led to your demise once.

102
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:30,852
Let's not create
a repeat performance, hmm?

103
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:33,637
On this planet,
the Luthors are cool-headed.

104
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:37,162
We plan,
we implement, and we rise...

105
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,339
together.

106
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,950
Show your sister
you believe in her.

107
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:44,518
Support her efforts.

108
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:47,564
She'll gravitate toward you
and away from the Kryptonian.

109
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:49,653
The question is...

110
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:53,962
can you give up
your pet vendetta
and stay focused?

111
00:05:54,005 --> 00:05:57,226
Are you really querying
my strength of will, Mother?

112
00:05:58,836 --> 00:05:59,837
I'm a Luthor.

113
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,622
Good.

114
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,887
Now go make Lena your ally.

115
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,499
All right,
so you'll be my friend now?

116
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:11,588
The world is ours now, Lena.

117
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,548
You don't need a robot.

118
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,724
And you don't need friends.

119
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:21,337
You need a partner.
Imagine what we could
accomplish together?

120
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:24,906
Why not give it a go?

121
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:26,777
You think
this is your world now?

122
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,783
You were a puppet on a string
for Leviathan before.

123
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,698
What makes this time
any different?

124
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,091
What the hell is Leviathan?

125
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,836
You see, that's the thing
about narcissists.

126
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,448
You're so focused on yourself,
you can never see
that you're the mark.

127
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:48,408
Your little fan-girl
was working for Leviathan
the entire time

128
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:49,931
she was working you.

129
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,368
Ms. Tessmacher.

130
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,807
And what exactly
does Leviathan want?

131
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,287
No one knows.

132
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,637
They're behind
seismic catastrophes,

133
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:02,465
earthquakes, floods, plagues.

134
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,729
They're alien, ancient,
and all-powerful.

135
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:07,818
And if it wasn't
for your hubris,

136
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,951
you would've seen that
they were playing you.

137
00:07:12,388 --> 00:07:13,998
All right, Lena.

138
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,436
You've had your fun letting me
know I let my eye off the ball.

139
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:21,571
I'll admit this Leviathan
is... irritating.

140
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,052
What are you gonna do?

141
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,314
Exterminate them.

142
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,752
Hello, National City!

143
00:07:28,796 --> 00:07:33,496
Well, by now you might've heard that my splashy show at ToyCon
caused, well...

144
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,976
Hi, boys.

145
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,239
Just stopping by
to examine the ship
for the DEO.

146
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,764
That's your cue to leave
and wait outside.

147
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,854
Search for Leviathan.

148
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:47,858
Oh...

149
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:49,338
Of course.

150
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,688
Show me all of her associates.

151
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:54,909
Stop.

152
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,480
I underestimated you, Eve.

153
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,917
Give me everything you have
on this woman on this Earth.

154
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,056
Please...

155
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,504
It is really loud out there.

156
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,159
Lex Luthor?

157
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:30,553
What are you doing here?

158
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,207
I'm here to help you,
Ms. Tessmacher.

159
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:33,861
You know my name?

160
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:36,385
I know a lot more
than your name.

161
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,998
I know that you're brilliant.

162
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:45,525
I know that Leviathan
recruited you to work for them
as a spy and an assassin.

163
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,527
But you turned them down,

164
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,399
so they murdered your father
to change your mind.

165
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:53,141
I know that they've forced you
to do their bidding

166
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:57,580
by vowing to kill
your beloved mother
if you dare defy them.

167
00:08:57,624 --> 00:09:00,191
And I know
that you hate it,

168
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,890
because you're a good person.

169
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,109
Am I?

170
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,765
You are, Eve, believe me.

171
00:09:10,724 --> 00:09:14,075
I wouldn't be rescuing
someone I didn't think was
worthy of my time.

172
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:16,817
Nobody can fight Leviathan.

173
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,036
You're going to
have to trust me.
Do you think you can do that?

174
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,086
Better decide quick,
Ms. Tessmacher.

175
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:29,133
Stay with them,
and continue to bloody
those pretty little hands...

176
00:09:29,177 --> 00:09:33,529
or work with me
to destroy the people
who stole your life.

177
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,055
I don't want to kill anymore.

178
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:41,363
Good choice.

179
00:09:45,062 --> 00:09:46,368
So, what do you want from me?

180
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,111
Be my partner.

181
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:53,244
Keep working at Leviathan,
and be my eyes and ears.

182
00:09:53,288 --> 00:09:55,986
In return,
I promise I'll protect you.

183
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,949
And that you won't
have to do any of this
awful, dirty work anymore.

184
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:05,735
I'll do it for you.

185
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:14,004
Obsidian North is proud
to introduce Platinum,

186
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:18,530
a virtual reality experience
that will look, feel, and taste

187
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,924
more vivid than real life.

188
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,623
Give yourself
the gift of Platinum.

189
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:31,631
Ms. Tessmacher...

190
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:35,417
what is it?

191
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,681
I couldn't get Gamemnae
to take me
onto Leviathan's ship.

192
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:41,684
-I'm scared.
-Ah. Forgive me, Eve.

193
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:44,208
I should've eased your mind
days ago. Please.

194
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:46,036
Now, this is a live feed.

195
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,431
I'm sure you recognize
the sweet little house
you grew up in.

196
00:10:49,474 --> 00:10:52,434
There's your mother
baking in the kitchen.

197
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:54,828
But I suspect
what you don't recognize

198
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,700
is that sedan,
or those other two.

199
00:10:57,744 --> 00:11:00,790
Those cars belong
to ex-Mossad agents

200
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,271
that I've hired to guard
your mother around the clock.

201
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,841
How can I thank you,
Mr. Luthor?

202
00:11:07,884 --> 00:11:09,669
Lex, please.

203
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,672
And you can thank me
after we've found
the cold-blooded killer

204
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:13,847
who took your father's life.

205
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:17,372
We're a team, Eve.

206
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,376
I do have some good news.

207
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:26,729
I convinced Gamemnae
I would be most useful
at Obsidian...

208
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,644
on the Platinum project.

209
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,690
Well done! You are brilliant.

210
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,954
Well, we do have
one small problem.

211
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:36,434
The Luthor tech that
your sister convinced
Andrea Rojas

212
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:38,567
to put into
the Platinum infrastructure,

213
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,177
it helped solve the bio-link

214
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,266
when people were getting
toxic shock
eating virtual food.

215
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,834
I like to refer to that
as the lobster problem.

216
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:48,011
Or rather, middle America's
desire to be gluttons
without calories.

217
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,752
Well, it caused a glitch.

218
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,058
But...

219
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,452
Your fail-safe failed.

220
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,064
I assure you,
this glitch will be fixed

221
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,153
long before the launch
of Obsidian Platinum.

222
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,505
Don't worry, I found a way
to patch the glitch.

223
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:04,811
That's not a glitch.

224
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:06,856
That's my plan.

225
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:14,211
My colleague is retrieving
a code that digitizes
the human psyche,

226
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:16,518
enabling us to
make someone immortal

227
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,782
by uploading
their consciousness
into a computer.

228
00:12:19,826 --> 00:12:24,178
I believe we can reverse
the same code
and use it against Leviathan.

229
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:26,093
Then Leviathan is immortal
no more.

230
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,965
But I need an invitation
to get onto their ship.

231
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,882
Which means I need Gamemnae,
or Gemma, if you prefer,
to trust me.

232
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:35,189
And trust begins
with that glitch.

233
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,930
But if there's a glitch
and people are getting stuck,

234
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:38,192
nobody's gonna buy the lenses.

235
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:40,368
Correct. Leviathan will
need to fix it.

236
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:43,414
But they won't be able to
because you won't let them.

237
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,026
And when Leviathan
can't fix it,
they'll have to cover it up,

238
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:47,854
and that's where I come in.

239
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:50,682
I will help Gemma
with the cover-up.

240
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:53,381
Once she trusts you,
she'll give you an invitation
to the ship.

241
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:54,774
An engraved one.

242
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:57,646
So, you need to go back
to Obsidian

243
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,083
and make sure that glitch
does not get fixed,

244
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:01,911
or traced back to me or Lena.

245
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:02,825
Done.

246
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:07,003
What are you gonna do?

247
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,919
Start exerting pressure.

248
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,448
Give me another one.

249
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,800
Hell, you know what,
just give me the bottle.

250
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,064
My wife is cheating on me.

251
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,370
Tell me about it, man.

252
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:28,503
Maybe I can help.

253
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,728
Lex.

254
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,296
My new apartment,
it's a dream!

255
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,081
When you said that
you were getting me
a new place,

256
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:42,909
I thought you meant
a small studio somewhere.

257
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,998
You're very precious
to me, Eve.

258
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,130
No one's ever treated me
this way before.

259
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,654
It's time you realize
how wonderful you are.

260
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:52,353
But we still have a mission.
How is Obsidian?

261
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,659
I've been monitoring
all of the beta users.

262
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:58,359
And Richard Bates
still hasn't made a move
on his wife's virtual lover.

263
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,970
Not yet. Because his friend,
the bartender,

264
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:03,494
who turned out to be
an amazing hacker,
I might add,

265
00:14:03,538 --> 00:14:07,237
won't let him complete
his virtual torture chamber
until the time is right.

266
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,936
And I still need to
create trust with Leviathan.

267
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:12,982
Amy Sapphire.

268
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,898
She blames Obsidian's VR
for the death of her husband.

269
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:19,075
She threatened
Andrea Rojas' life.

270
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:23,514
-You're going to warn Gemma
to gain Leviathan's trust?
-The opposite.

271
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:27,997
We're gonna help Amy Sapphire
attack Andrea Rojas
and blow up Obsidian.

272
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:32,001
But if anyone attacks Obsidian,
Leviathan is gonna want me
to terminate them.

273
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:34,090
Gemma won't ask you
to assassinate anybody

274
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:36,527
because I will intervene
before she gets the chance.

275
00:14:36,571 --> 00:14:39,922
I will offer up Supergirl
to protect Andrea
and Obsidian.

276
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:44,274
Just make sure
that Amy Sapphire
gets these gauntlets.

277
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:46,537
It'll make her
a worthy adversary
for Supergirl.

278
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:50,019
And after Supergirl succeeds
in saving Andrea,

279
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:52,935
I will have proven myself
to Gemma.

280
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:57,635
And then, I will suggest that
I roll out Obsidian Platinum
worldwide.

281
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,638
Lex, you're brilliant.

282
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,728
But beyond that,
you are so kind.

283
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,165
-And I think I'm--
-I know, Eve.

284
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:07,907
I feel the same.

285
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,692
But we have to stay focused
on our goals,

286
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:13,564
free you from them
and avenge your father.

287
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,003
There'll be time for us later.

288
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:19,831
Now, I have to
show you something.

289
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,665
Oh, they're so cute!

290
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:31,278
Aww!

291
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:33,889
Q-waves?

292
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,456
Something like that.

293
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,202
Aw, he likes you.

294
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:43,246
He's happy.

295
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:46,336
That one isn't.

296
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,905
Oh, gosh!
That didn't work right.

297
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:54,040
Actually, it worked perfectly.

298
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,005
Amy, no!

299
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:10,317
This can't be right.

300
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:20,501
Do you need to get that, dear?

301
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:23,069
Not important.

302
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,551
Ms. Tessmacher,
why have you brought me

303
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,554
to the world's saddest
urgent care center?

304
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:34,558
People have begun
getting stuck in the VR,
just like you anticipated.

305
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:37,953
Uh, Gemma asked me
to look into the glitch.

306
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,563
I told her that
there was nothing we could do

307
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,043
without shutting down
the entire system,

308
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:45,134
which can't be shut down
thanks to Luthor PowerCore.

309
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:48,050
She asked Margot
to start cleaning things up.

310
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:51,749
Who or what is a Margot?

311
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,751
Leviathan middle-management...

312
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:57,190
and a mean old hag to boot.

313
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,627
It's time
to set Richard loose.

314
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,066
This is a back door
that will allow Richard Bates
to hack into Platinum

315
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:05,633
to get revenge.

316
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,852
That'll put welcome eyes
on Obsidian's problems

317
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:10,029
as this place starts
to fill up with bodies.

318
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,378
Make sure he gets it.

319
00:17:11,421 --> 00:17:16,078
Oh, and I have
something else for you.

320
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:21,040
Perfume?

321
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:25,522
Uh-uh... Perfume, poison...
Potayto, potahto.

322
00:17:25,566 --> 00:17:28,047
What you're holding
is the deadliest substance
on Earth.

323
00:17:29,918 --> 00:17:33,139
You told me I wouldn't have to
kill for Leviathan ever again.

324
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,097
And I always keep my promises.

325
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,360
Every single one.

326
00:17:37,404 --> 00:17:40,624
That's why I tracked down
the man who murdered
your father...

327
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:41,756
just like I said I would.

328
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:43,801
Who is he?

329
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,848
A Leviathan enforcer.

330
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,807
He's in the Peruvian Andes
working undercover with an NGO.

331
00:17:49,851 --> 00:17:52,419
I suspect
because he has a target there.

332
00:17:52,462 --> 00:17:54,290
I should put a bullet
in his head.

333
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:56,075
It's the least he deserves.

334
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,861
But we can't go to war
with Leviathan.

335
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,515
It has to look like
an accident.

336
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:02,951
You can handle that, right?

337
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:03,952
Yes.

338
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,649
Then be quick.

339
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:08,261
I don't expect that
he will stay in one place
for very long.

340
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:09,827
And nor will I.

341
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:11,916
It's time for me to embark
on my world tour,

342
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,136
hawking Obsidian lenses.

343
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,573
The beginning of the end...

344
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,748
of Leviathan.

345
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:23,580
"Our lives are connected

346
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,756
by 1,000 invisible threads."

347
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,543
Those immortal words
by Herman Melville

348
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:32,807
are realized today
with Obsidian technology.

349
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:36,245
This is my house!

350
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:38,465
-And this is my gun.

351
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,424
But with
Obsidian Platinum,

352
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:42,904
you hold the thread.

353
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,255
You are the architect
of your world!

354
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,649
-They found Dad.
-Jeremiah?

355
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,303
He's dead.

356
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:51,695
And not only your world,

357
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:53,436
but the world.

358
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,264
There is nothing you cannot

359
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,005
manipulate to your own ends.

360
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,442
Nothing you cannot control!

361
00:18:59,486 --> 00:19:01,966
So are you blowing off steam
playing hero,

362
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,447
or working something out?

363
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:06,145
♪ I never lost control

364
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:11,193
♪ You're face to face

♪ With the man

366
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:14,892

something special,

00:19:14,936 --> 00:19:17,243
something unique,
something rare,

368
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:18,766
and that, my friends,

369
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,116
is control!

370
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,076
-Complete and total control!

371
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:35,174
One hundred countries,
worldwide saturation.

372
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:39,221
It took 40 years
for the cell phone to
reach as many users

373
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:42,485
as our lenses have reached
in one month.

374
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:46,924
All thanks
to our passionate ambassador,
Lex Luthor.

Kara...

378
00:20:15,344 --> 00:20:16,650
I heard about Jeremiah.

379
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,349
I came to offer up sympathies.

380
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,572
"Offer up
my sympathies."

381
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,356
-God, I sound like an android.
-No.

382
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,053
No, you said it like someone

383
00:20:29,097 --> 00:20:30,794
who's afraid
to confront the woman
who called you a villain.

384
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,408
My mother died
when I was very young.

385
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:38,149
And I'm...

386
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,849
I know that pales
in comparison to the losses
that you've suffered,

387
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,590
but I know
it doesn't get any easier.

388
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:46,462
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:53,252
Thank you for saying that.
That means a lot
coming from you.

390
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,345
Um...

391
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:03,566
This helped me a lot
with memories of my mother

392
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,742
and other family difficulties.

393
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,658
Well, if it helped with
Luthor family difficulties,

394
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,225
I'm sure it'll help me a lot.

395
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:15,535
Thank you.

396
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:39,428
You missed a perfectly fine en passant
capture opportunity.

397
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:42,126
You're distracted.
What's wrong?

398
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,825
She apologized to her.

399
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,696
Be clear
with your pronouns, dear.

400
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,092
Lena apologized to Kara.
To Supergirl.

401
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,528
For the death of Jeremiah.

402
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,617
-I thought
you put that behind you.
-I did!

403
00:21:54,661 --> 00:21:57,664
The assassination
of Jeremiah Danvers was
the perfect chess move,

404
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,667
but for the fact that
it maddeningly drove Lena
back to Supergirl!

405
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,583
And the worst part is
that I didn't even see it
as a possibility.

406
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,367
So, yes, Mother,
I missed the en passant.

407
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,195
I'm missing a lot of things,
I'm slipping.

408
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:10,416
The only thing
you're slipping off of
is the wagon.

409
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:13,375
So Lena showed the alien
a little humanity?

410
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,246
-What's wrong with that?
-It pushes the limit.

411
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,161
First, it's an apology.

412
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:19,207
Then, it's coffee before work.

413
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,730
Next thing you know,
they're playing Pictionary.
That cannot happen!

414
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,343
I know what to do.

415
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,823
I'll set up Supergirl.

416
00:22:26,867 --> 00:22:28,782
You already
have a plan in place
with Leviathan.

417
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,523
I did, but this is better.

418
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:33,917
Why use a nuke
to create a catastrophe
to draw Leviathan out,

419
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:38,269
when I can use a Sun-Eater
to turn Lena against
Kara Danvers in one stroke?

420
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,664
I asked you if you had
the strength of will,

421
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,971
and you said, "Yes, Mother!"

422
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,017
This is a display of weakness.

423
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,585
Not weakness, Mother.

424
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,372
Inspiration.

425
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:55,809
Checkmate.

426
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:01,641
Ms. Tessmacher,
it's time to activate
William Dey.

427
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,425
Make sure your contact
gives him the name

428
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,253
on the medical bracelet
he found.

429
00:23:05,296 --> 00:23:07,908
And then,
I need you to move the bodies.

430
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,737
Don't you think
that it's weird

431
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,653
that we're sitting here
eating dumplings
like everything is normal,

432
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:16,395
and yet, Jeremiah is gone?

433
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:20,094
No. The only permanent thing
about life is
that things change.

434
00:23:20,137 --> 00:23:21,835
The cycle of life goes on.

435
00:23:21,878 --> 00:23:24,359
And you... still need to eat.

436
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,405
Yeah, you know what,
this book the Lena gave me

437
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:28,885
actually has
strikingly similar advice.

438
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:31,235
"Things are constantly in flux,

439
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,716
arising and passing
with each moment."

440
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,329
-We have no control,
so eat the dumplings.
-Yeah.

441
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:41,376
Well, I still can't believe
the fact that she gave you that
after everything that happened.

442
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,683
Well, maybe she's
coming around.

443
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,162
-Seeing the light about Lex.

444
00:23:45,902 --> 00:23:47,469
No. No light about him.

445
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,993
-That man is--
-The devil incarnate.

446
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,386
-Yes.
-Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

447
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,737
I hope you weren't
talking about me.

448
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:59,089
No. No, no, no.
Lex Luthor.

449
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:01,135
-And are these baked goods?
-Yes.

450
00:24:01,178 --> 00:24:03,790
Scones, sticky toffee pudding,
and banoffee pie,

451
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,053
all my mother's
favorite recipes
for comfort food.

452
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:08,359
-I... I hope it helps.

453
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:09,839
Oh, my God!

454
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,885
You made all of this?

455
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:15,018
Well, I didn't want to
show up empty-handed
coming here, asking for help...

456
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,760
with a story on Lex Luthor
and Obsidian.

457
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,283
You got a lead?

458
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,416
Wait, you, you both
have been working on this?

459
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,637
Before your father's funeral,
Kelly and I were onto this idea

460
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,508
that Lex had done something
to Obsidian

461
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,293
to cause people
to get stuck in VR
and disappear.

462
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:30,991
The missing people were
wearing Obsidian lenses.

463
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:32,471
And a friend of mine
from the NSA

464
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,212
found a cluster of users
all at the same address,

465
00:24:35,256 --> 00:24:36,562
a warehouse.

466
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:39,086
But when I checked,
it was empty.

467
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:41,828
Only weird thing was
a hospital ID bracelet
on the ground.

468
00:24:41,871 --> 00:24:43,307
So, I checked it
for fingerprints.

469
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,353
I found one and sent it
to my buddy at the NSA.

470
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,008
Now, he just called me back
with results when I was baking.

471
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:51,446
The bracelet belonged
to a Richard Bates.

472
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,448
The same person
who hacked
Obsidian's fail-safe.

473
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,928
And who I beat up in VR.

474
00:24:54,971 --> 00:24:56,843
One and the same.

475
00:24:56,886 --> 00:24:58,671
And get this...

476
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:02,544
The hospital has no record
of a Richard Bates
ever being admitted.

477
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:06,548
Wait a minute. Kelly, you said
there was a list of users that
are still stuck in VR, right?

478
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,768
-Can you show me that?
-Yeah.

479
00:25:08,811 --> 00:25:11,988
Here. This is
the current list of users.

480
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:17,037
Bonnie.
I met this girl in VR.

481
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,082
Why would anyone want
to keep her there?

482
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,780
Human testing.
Organ harvesting.

483
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:22,825
And if people
are getting hurt in Obsidian,

484
00:25:22,869 --> 00:25:26,089
we need to find out about it
and expose them.

485
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:28,439
If we find the proof,
I'll run the story.

486
00:25:28,483 --> 00:25:30,354
It'll be around the globe
in minutes.

487
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,270
The world will know
if Obsidian is
endangering them.

488
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,445
They're on your tail.

489
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:37,013
It doesn't matter.

490
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:40,364
Our cloaking technology
will cover all our bases
from the human eye.

491
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:42,541
They won't stop
until they uncover the truth.

492
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,587
And what is that exactly?

493
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:48,982
That you and your
Leviathan associates

494
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,506
are ancient beings

495
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,377
who manage humanity's

496
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,337
excesses.

497
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,993
Don't get me wrong,
Gemma,
or Gamemnae,

498
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:02,517
or would you prefer, uh,
Goddess of Technology?

499
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,388
I approve.

500
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,782
Pompei was spectacular,

501
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:09,176
the Black Plague, intriguing,

502
00:26:09,219 --> 00:26:14,268
and your current move,
creating an addiction
to Obsidian Platinum, genius.

503
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:19,490
-The only problem is
your plan is now at risk.
-No, it's not.

504
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:23,190
I'll pull up the timeline
for our VR global event.

505
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:27,020
It'll be a happening beyond
humanity's wildest dreams.

506
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:29,718
A virtual gathering of
everyone around the world.

507
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:32,242
No one will want to miss it.

508
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:34,984
And once the masses are in VR,

509
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,986
I'll kill them all
with a flick of my wrist.

510
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,294
That would be great,
if you weren't
about to be exposed.

511
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,905
Obsidian will be shut down,
all the lenses returned

512
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:44,646
before you sell
the first ticket.

513
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,430
You don't have
the luxury of time.

514
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,867
What do you propose?

515
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,304
Create fear.

516
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:53,481
It's instantaneous,
and I have a specific idea
of how to do it.

517
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:55,962
I just need
your stealthiest operative.

518
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:02,490
Director Dox,
long time no see.

519
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,798
I come bearing gifts,
a pysanka.

520
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:09,236
Gifted to me
by a Ukrainian holy man
on my world tour.

521
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,500
It brings love and wealth,
and of course fertility.

522
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,807
Does it also bring
the end of Leviathan?

523
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,813
You were meant to have gotten
the location of their ship...

524
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:23,598
so we can implant
the mortality code.

525
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,296
I can't push them.

526
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,211
This delay doesn't have
anything to do

527
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:31,301
with you using
Obsidian Platinum for
your own ends, does it?

528
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:34,565
Alex Danvers called me.

529
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:37,177
She wants me to help her
track Obsidian users

530
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,570
she believes are being
lured into some type of coma.

531
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,964
By you.

532
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:46,360
While it is utterly predictable
that Alex Danvers
would call you,

533
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,406
it's not me behind
your missing users,
it's Leviathan.

534
00:27:50,494 --> 00:27:52,018
Scout's honor.

535
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,584
I found out from Gemma Cooper.

536
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,630
Then help me find them.

537
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,937
You have the Q-wave cube
from Winn's ship.

538
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,375
I can use it
to track the lenses,
find the missing people.

539
00:28:01,418 --> 00:28:04,334
Ah, well, I gave the cube
to Lena.

540
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:07,642
And if you involved her,
Leviathan would kill her.

541
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,253
And as much as
I'd like to help you,
I can't.

542
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:13,300
Leviathan would find out,
and then I'd be their enemy.

543
00:28:13,343 --> 00:28:16,477
And as you know,
the long-term success
of our plan

544
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,740
relies on me
being the opposite.

545
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,829
But, by all means,
you should help them.

546
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:23,049
I know how important
your friends are to you.

547
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,052
Okay.

548
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,924
Lex, how shall I help them?

549
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:32,145
There's nothing at the DEO
that could track Q-waves.

550
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:37,193
Why don't you ask Supergirl?

551
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:40,631
I'm sure there's something
at that fortress of hers
that could help.

552
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,421
Hey, any luck
with the warehouse?

553
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:48,901
It was empty.

554
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,338
I was able to pick up
Richard Bates' psychic signal,

555
00:28:51,381 --> 00:28:54,036
along with dozens of
other people in that warehouse.

556
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,778
But when I tried to connect,
there was
some kind of interference.

557
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:01,783
It's because Obsidian is
adding Platinum users
by the minute.

558
00:29:01,827 --> 00:29:05,439
The lenses interface
with the brain
by using Q-waves...

559
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,006
which operate
on a similar frequency

560
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,877
as Malefic's Martian brain.

561
00:29:08,921 --> 00:29:11,750
Just as I can't connect
with Mal, I can't find
those missing people.

562
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,492
You can connect with them...

563
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,843
by using Myriad.

564
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:23,936
Lena wanted
to use Myriad to disperse
her Q-wave mind control,

565
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:25,459
but if you turn it on
in reverse,

566
00:29:25,502 --> 00:29:28,767
it will compress the Q-waves
in the atmosphere...

567
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:31,465
making it possible
for you to track
the psychic signatures.

568
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,904
And it wouldn't be dangerous?

569
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,558
In your hands, no.

570
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:40,474
Then I'll go.

571
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,345
But I don't like it.

572
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:48,569
The brain anatomy
of Patient 054 remains normal
post-Non Nocere.

573
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:52,660
The trial continues to exhibit
positive results
of Q-wave adoption.

574
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,793
Brava!

575
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:57,578
You've always been
so meticulous about
your data collection.

576
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,842
-What is that?

577
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,457
I use a Q-wave broadcast
to remotely access
patients' brain activity.

578
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,851
It's being interrupted
by an overlapping signal.

579
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:12,027
How could someone
suppress Q-waves?

580
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,381
I recognize the signature
of this interruption,
it's Myriad.

581
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:21,602
Yesterday, I thought
I had an honest conversation
with Supergirl,

582
00:30:21,645 --> 00:30:26,563
and today I find out
that she's using Myriad
to interrupt my experiments?

583
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:29,697
The very device she told me
was too dangerous
for anyone to use.

584
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,568
You saw Supergirl yesterday?

585
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,313
I could always just
go to the Fortress,
if you told me where it was,

586
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,925
and turn off Myriad
before she interferes again.

587
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,665
No, you'll set off
the El Protocol.

588
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:42,971
This is a new world.

589
00:30:43,015 --> 00:30:45,234
One where Luthors
and Kryptonians work together.

590
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:47,933
The fortress security won't be
programmed to attack us.

591
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,587
If she's using Myriad,
I wanna see it for myself.

592
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,460
Besides, you at the fortress
sounds apocalyptic.

593
00:30:54,678 --> 00:30:55,505
Well...

594
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:58,944
then let this ride be on me.

595
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:19,965
You are using Myriad.

596
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:21,314
Lena, what are you doing here?

597
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:24,099
Question is, what are you
doing here, Supergirl?

598
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,666
I thought it was forbidden
to use Myriad,

599
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,494
but forbidden
for anyone but you.

600
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:30,758
There are people missing,
dozens of them stuck
in Obsidian's VR.

601
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:32,151
I have to find them.

602
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:33,848
There are other ways
to find people than Myriad.

603
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,589
I can think of four
off the top of my head,

604
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,199
but you,
you do what you want.

605
00:31:37,243 --> 00:31:40,072
What I'm doing
is finding people
your brother disappeared.

606
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,900
Do you have any proof
that it was Lex?

607
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:44,772
No, I didn't think so.

608
00:31:44,815 --> 00:31:48,254
You just return
to your default position
of blaming a Luthor.

609
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:50,299
You did tell me you'd
treat me like a villain...

610
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,737
If you acted like one,
yeah, I did say that.

611
00:31:53,781 --> 00:31:56,044
And right now,
you're trespassing,
and I don't have time for this.

612
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,176
You need to go.

613
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,917
I'll leave
when you stop using Myriad.

614
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,181
That's not gonna happen.

615
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:05,749
To think that I was
sincere with you yesterday...

616
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,928
Then I guess
you're used to being two-faced.

617
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:24,768
No!

618
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,386
Why is this taking so long?

619
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:36,084
It takes several minutes
for Myriad to suppress
the Q-waves long enough

620
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,259
for J'onn to see clearly.

621
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:42,482
What is that?

622
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,093
A Sun-Eater.

623
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:47,182
That's impossible.

624
00:32:47,226 --> 00:32:48,444
The only one in the system...

625
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:51,926
is the baby
from the Fortress of Solitude.

626
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:53,536
Supergirl?

627
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,496
Supergirl, are you there?

628
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:58,367
The Sun-Eater must've absorbed
her power.

629
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,674
Okay, well, we need to
save her. Like now.

630
00:33:00,717 --> 00:33:03,198
We can use a Lexosuit
from the DEO.

631
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:06,897
If we recalibrate
the suit's internal radiation
to 1,000 watts per meter,

632
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,987
it will act like
a mini-sunlight chamber.

633
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,771
We'll get it
and bring it to the fortress.

634
00:33:13,252 --> 00:33:15,645
-M'gann?
-J'onn...

635
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:18,387
your brother felt the Q-waves
on Mars and sent me.

636
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,172
My ship is armed
with hydrogen weapons

637
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:21,608
we can use
to stop the Sun-Eater.

638
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:25,133
Han Solo never looked so good.

639
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:27,875
-That was
a Star Warsreference.
-I know it. I know. Yeah.

640
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,445
Let's go save the sun.

641
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,124
Oh, heaven to Betsy.

642
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:20,623
The hydrogen explosive
should reduce it to a size
that we can contain.

643
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,844
If I can detonate one
inside it

644
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,933
and saturate it
like water with a fire.

645
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:27,935
I have faith in you,
J'onn J'onzz.

646
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:37,814
J'onn?

647
00:34:49,652 --> 00:34:51,393
Anyone see a Sun-Eater
around here?

648
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,091
Supergirl!

649
00:34:57,138 --> 00:35:01,186
We think we can shrink it
by detonating this explosive
in its core.

650
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:03,318
Lucky this suit has
its own explosives.

651
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:08,106
Missiles hot!

652
00:35:32,652 --> 00:35:33,783
Right on schedule.

653
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,401
Ms. Tessmacher!

654
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,450
That thing is
much cuter when it's smaller.

655
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:50,539
Yeah, and not destroying
the solar system.

656
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,368
Have you figured out
what the Morae wanted
or who she works for?

657
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:58,068
She says she works
for someone called Leviathan.

658
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:03,248
-J'onn, what is it?

659
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,772
Myriad... the psychic trail.

660
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,862
I know where
those missing people are.

661
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:18,567
Lex, a real hero?
How can this be true?

662
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,091
If you weren't so obsessed
with trying to persecute me,

663
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:22,615
you might see that
on this Earth,

664
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,573
I've always been the hero.

665
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:26,445
All these people say so.

666
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:29,012
But I guess
we're all heroes today,

667
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:33,147
since I'm assuming
you and your friends
dealt with the big blackout.

668
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,844
You're not gonna
try and pin that on me,
are you?

669
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:38,805
No, that was... Leviathan.

670
00:36:38,848 --> 00:36:42,765
The same Leviathan that
I told you would be a problem
months ago?

671
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:46,813
Perhaps if you listened to me
and tried to work with me,

672
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,207
we could stop
these dangerous organizations

673
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,818
before they try
to blot out the sun.

674
00:36:51,861 --> 00:36:54,734
So, do you know what they want,

675
00:36:54,777 --> 00:36:56,083
or where their base is?

676
00:36:56,126 --> 00:36:57,563
Not yet.

677
00:36:57,606 --> 00:36:59,869
-But we will.
-We're going to stop them.

678
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:05,440
You murdered Margot!

679
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:08,400
One of my own,
one of Leviathan's
most trusted agents.

680
00:37:08,443 --> 00:37:10,445
Margot's death was unfortunate.

681
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:13,361
But she had to die,
given the breadth of our--

682
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,712
You don't tell me anything.

683
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,105
I am a god.

684
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:19,411
You are a nothing.

685
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:20,586
Do you understand?

686
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:26,940
Explain yourself.

687
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,079
As I said earlier...

688
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:39,213
the Supers were close
to finding your comatose souls.

689
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,346
So, I had to find them first.

690
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:44,740
I moved them,
and then pinned their existence
on someone else.

691
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,960
So, I connected Margot
to Amy Sapphire

692
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:49,310
and divorced her
from you and Leviathan.

693
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,920
Because of what I did,

694
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:54,707
no one is suspecting
Obsidian anymore.

695
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,535
Maybe you were right
to kill Margot,

696
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:00,539
but you made a mistake
with the disaster.

697
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:03,759
And now the Kryptonian
has one of my assassins
in her custody!

698
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,371
I underestimated Supergirl
and her team.

699
00:38:06,414 --> 00:38:09,765
The chaos of the disaster
was working
until she intervened.

700
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:11,854
But now I know

701
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,770
you were right about
the global VR celebration.

702
00:38:14,814 --> 00:38:17,033
We should
implement it immediately.

703
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:19,949
Gather everyone into VR
at once...

704
00:38:19,993 --> 00:38:21,864
with this
sparkling distraction.

705
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,127
But first...

706
00:38:25,128 --> 00:38:26,739
we must kill Supergirl.

707
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,176
She will always foil the plan.

708
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,613
And a warning...

709
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:33,833
no mere mortal can kill her.

710
00:38:33,876 --> 00:38:35,704
Many have tried and failed.

711
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:44,278
I will not fail.

712
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,682
Do I smell Beef Wellington?

713
00:38:56,725 --> 00:39:00,294
Victory and role-playing
makes me hungry.

714
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,035
"Amy Sapphire was right.

715
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:05,386
Technology is the greatest evil
mankind has ever faced."

716
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,822
Okay, stop there.

717
00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:09,869
Please don't ever image-induce
into her ever again.

718
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:13,089
-I might lose my appetite.

719
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,353
I'm so glad
we finally have a night

720
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,006
to spend some time alone
as a couple.

721
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:18,660
A couple?

722
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,577
I've been trying to tell you
how I feel...

723
00:39:22,621 --> 00:39:26,189
and it's not just
because you helped me
escape Leviathan,

724
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:27,887
it's because of who you are.

725
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:31,281
How could I not love you?

726
00:39:32,805 --> 00:39:33,806
Oh...

727
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,765
Ms. Tessmacher...

728
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:41,422
you sad, silly woman...

729
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,293
of course you love me.

730
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:46,296
What's funny is, you thought
I could love you back.

731
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,692
I don't understand.

732
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,129
We're a team.

733
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:56,655
-We're meant to be together.
We're destined--
-Oh, we're destined.

734
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:59,527
On another world,
in another life, we knew
each other very well.

735
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:01,790
And in that life,
you said you loved me, too.

736
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:04,227
You distracted me,
you made me weaker.

737
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,360
But that's not happening
this time, honey.

738
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,275
I feel nothing for you.

739
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:10,408
I saved you
because you were useful.

740
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,453
I needed a spy
inside Leviathan.

741
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,760
Oh, and as for your mother...

742
00:40:14,803 --> 00:40:17,893
she's still in danger,
but from me.

743
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:20,374
Those cars I showed you,
the men in them

744
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,290
are just waiting
to pull the trigger
if you ever betray me.

745
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,858
But I'd think twice
about that.

746
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,947
That man you killed
in the Andes

747
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,079
didn't murder your father.

748
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:32,473
I never bothered to find out
who knocked off
your old man.

749
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,344
No, the man you murdered

750
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:35,998
is Supergirl's father.

751
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:42,483
Oh, that's good.

752
00:40:42,527 --> 00:40:45,443
I have video of you
killing him, by the way.

753
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,357
Defy me, and I'll pass it on.

754
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:50,491
Believe me, you do not
want to be on the wrong side
of those laser eyes.

755
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:54,016
You are worse than Leviathan.

756
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:55,975
Not worse.

757
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,412
Better.

758
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,763
- Mother.

759
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:05,114
Hate to say I told you so,
but it all went
according to plan.

760
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:08,466
Lena's back on my side,
Leviathan is set to
kill our enemies,

761
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,337
and I'm set
to wipe out Leviathan.

762
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,207
And...

763
00:41:12,252 --> 00:41:13,471
I did it my way.

764
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:33,665
Ah, screw it.
