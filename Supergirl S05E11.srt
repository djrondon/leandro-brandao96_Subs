1
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:01,322
Come with me if you wanna live.

2
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,204
-Ta-da!

3
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,510
- Oh...
- You okay?

4
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:17,207
Your candy tray awaits,
milady.

5
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,167
Okay, guys.
I appreciate the breakup feast,
but I'm fine.

6
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,300
And deny us a night
of guilt-free chocolate?
I don't think so.

7
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,694
Really. I think it's good
Brainy and I broke up.

8
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,304
Right.

9
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,393
I'm being honest.
Look...

10
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,265
Brainy clearly has some...

11
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,484
emotional complexities
that I wasn't aware of.

12
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:37,140
And whether that's because
of the personality inhibitors
or not,

13
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:38,750
it's better to know now.

14
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,840
Well, I will be honest.
I am a bit worried
about Brainy.

15
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,799
Yeah. I mean,
it must be so strange

16
00:01:43,842 --> 00:01:46,541
to have your whole self
just shift like that.

17
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:50,675
So, how's it been at the DEO?

18
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,808
Can't believe Lex owns it
in this universe.

19
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:56,942
Employees get stock options
and four weeks paid vacation.

20
00:01:56,986 --> 00:01:59,249
But no beach vacation
can mask evil.

21
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,383
Just wish we knew
what he was up to.

22
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,478
Ooh, you're welcome

23
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,566
for the breakout,

24
00:02:12,088 --> 00:02:13,089
by the way.

25
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:17,267
You know, I figured
I would save my thanks

26
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:18,921
until after I heard
your proposition.

27
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,707
Hmm, that's a bold stance

28
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,057
from a guy who
got himself arrested, what,

29
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:28,365
16 hours after coming here
from another Earth?

30
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,541
So, I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt.

31
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,413
Aw, that's very kind of you.

32
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:34,850
And since you know
so much about me,

33
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:37,766
why don't you tell me
who the hell you are?

34
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,550
The name's Lex Luthor.

35
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:40,986
That's a weird name.

36
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,119
No weirder than Toyman.

37
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,339
That was your father's name,
wasn't it?

38
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,515
You need to think bigger.

39
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:49,647
Like your dad.

40
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:52,084
He was gonna be
the biggest toymaker
of all time.

41
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,391
Just moved
into virtual reality, but,

42
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,568
mmm, his partner
stole his patent, right?

43
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,744
Right, and then he snapped.

44
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:02,051
People say he went
on a rampage.

45
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:09,101
I say that they had it coming.

46
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:12,279
And then,
he killed himself.

47
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:17,545
Wouldn't you like to show them
how wrong they were?

48
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,550
That's what I was doing.

49
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,943
What you were doing
was getting caught.

50
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,642
But with my resources,

51
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:30,210
you could make the Schott name
synonymous with genius

52
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:33,996
and chaos instead of failure
and... who?

53
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,258
I have something for you.

54
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,482
The National City
Toy Convention.

55
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:46,661
And, as a bonus,
I believe an old friend
of yours,

56
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:48,228
Chester Dunholtz,
will be there.

57
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,710
Well, it has been a pleasure
doing business with you,
Winslow.

58
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:53,842
Oh, and one more thing,

59
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:56,323
whatever you do,

60
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,195
make it splashy.

61
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,329
If we're gonna build you
a legacy, it's gonna need to
survive well into the future.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,164
Lena.

63
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,297
Just the Luthor
I was hoping to find.

64
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:16,560
Did you look for me
in my office?

65
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:19,476
Where I said I would be,
working on Non Nocere,
waiting for you.

66
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,696
Ooh, right, sorry.
Something came up.

67
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,743
This new universe has shifted
the frequency of Q-waves.

68
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:27,963
I'm back at square one.
I needed your help.

69
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,487
I understand,
but we have bigger problems,

70
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:34,491
like Leviathan.
You undersold them, sweet Lena.

71
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:35,753
He's right.

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,671
Leviathan is the greatest
threat of our time.

73
00:04:40,715 --> 00:04:43,979
-Brainy.
-Agent Dox is assisting me
with a project.

74
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,850
You know he's friends
with Supergirl, right?

75
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:47,635
There's no need
for concern.

76
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:51,073
Since I removed
my personality inhibitors,
I run on logic only.

77
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:54,903
And my calculations tell me
that, at this time, Lex Luthor

78
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:57,862
is on the right side
of history.

79
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,908
Can you promise me
no one will get hurt?

80
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:02,214
I promise no one
will be harmed.

81
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,347
Especially
if you help us.

82
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,088
As with the Q-waves,

83
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:08,699
the recent fusing
of the universes
might have shifted

84
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:11,398
what Andrea Rojas knows
about Leviathan.

85
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:12,877
If there was some way of

86
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:15,967
-finding out--
-You want me to talk to Andrea?

87
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,274
It won't do any good.
She's not gonna
tell me anything.

88
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,624
We're not friends.

89
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:23,410
The Lena I know wouldn't let
a little thing like friendship

90
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,977
get in the way
of saving the world.

91
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:30,678
And as a thank you,
I can guarantee you
a source of Q-waves

92
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,419
by the end of tomorrow.

93
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,596
Well,
if you will excuse me,

94
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:38,294
I have to get my beauty sleep.

95
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,035
They're unveiling
my new action figure

96
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,993
at National City Toycon
tomorrow.

97
00:05:42,037 --> 00:05:43,952
I anticipate many photo ops.

98
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,879
There are so many.

99
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,968
I expected to be
a collector's item.

100
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:01,839
-Kara Danvers?
-There he is.

101
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:04,625
How did I get so lucky
that CatCo would send
their Pulitzer winner

102
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,975
to cover the unveiling
of my little trinket?

103
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:09,151
We are the lucky ones,
Mr. Luthor.

104
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:11,109
And who is this
new cub reporter?

105
00:06:11,153 --> 00:06:12,720
-William Dey.
-Mmm.

106
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,330
I covered your Kasnian victory
for The Times of London.

107
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,072
I remember that piece.
You called me fat.

108
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:18,726
I believe it was bloated ego,

109
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,641
and in reference
to your victory parade.

110
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:22,207
Oh, yes!
That was a good parade.

111
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,818
Oh, shame Supergirl
couldn't make it.

112
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:26,429
-Ah...
-I bet your editor would
have loved a twofer.

113
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:28,431
Say, she's a friend of yours,
isn't she,

114
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:32,653
Ms. Danvers? I mean,
how would Supergirl feel
about these action figures?

115
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:36,265
-Two heroes saving the world.

116
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:40,443
You know what?
I'm more interested
in how you feel, sir.

117
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:41,488
Uh, in a word,

118
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,054
valiant.

119
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,143
Mr. Luthor,
is it true you plan to develop

120
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:47,494
Shelley Island
as an energy source?

121
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,844
This planet is in
an energy crisis.

122
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,498
I'm just trying to do my part.

123
00:06:51,541 --> 00:06:54,805
Is that why you attempted
to take over
Rogers Engineering?

124
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,503
You wanted to get
into biomechanics,

125
00:06:56,546 --> 00:07:00,158
but Russell Rogers
refused to sell,
and he disappeared.

126
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:02,378
You don't know what happened
to him, do you?

127
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,467
No.

128
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:06,382
And this has been a delight.

129
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,646
I have a very busy day.
Why don't you take
one of these, on the house?

130
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,519
-Uh, Ms. Danvers,
a quick word, please?
-Yes, I'll be right back.

131
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:17,349
This was supposed
to be a puff piece.

132
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:20,004
Why did I just get
Frost/Nixoned by a Boy Scout?

133
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:23,399
Since I have been
on this Earth, I have done
nothing but protect and serve.

134
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,358
Judging me for the crimes
of another Earth's Lex, well,
that's not fair now, is it?

135
00:07:26,402 --> 00:07:28,709
I'm gonna find out
what you're doing at the DEO.

136
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,363
So much moxie!

137
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:36,847
Let me make myself clear.
If young Woodward decides
to proceed with his Lexpose,

138
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:40,285
it will prove very,
very dangerous for his health,
off the record.

139
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,200
-Have a nice day.

140
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:44,028
Kara Danvers is Supergirl.

141
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:45,247
-Give me that.

142
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,774
Supergirl, there's an armed
sniper at the toy convention.

143
00:07:50,818 --> 00:07:52,428
-I'm already there.
-Great, we're almost there.

144
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
I'll look for him.

145
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:03,961
We need this place evacuated
and locked down.
We do not wanna cause a panic.

146
00:08:13,797 --> 00:08:15,233
Does this feel like...

147
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:17,453
Like Toyman.

148
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,325
They're bombs.

149
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:24,329
He's got a gun!

150
00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:30,422
Up there! Up there!

151
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,731
-Wait, that looks just like--
-Winn! But how?

152
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,387
Oh, no!

153
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,305
What?

154
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,627
Winn?

155
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,932
What are you doing here?

156
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,282
Saving Chester Dunholtz
and my future.

157
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:05,806
Have you seen Toyman?

158
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:08,678
-Uh...
-The shooter! The guy
wearing my face!

159
00:09:14,162 --> 00:09:15,816
-I've got him.

160
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,137
Oh, come on, come on!

161
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:34,922
Damn it. Brainy,

162
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:37,011
I need you to lock on
to every traffic camera
in National City,

163
00:09:37,054 --> 00:09:39,361
and please,
please find this guy.

164
00:09:39,404 --> 00:09:41,885
Winn, stop.
Okay, just breathe

165
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,366
for a minute, okay?
We're gonna find the other you,

166
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:46,629
-and then we'll stop him
before he hurts someone.
-We always do.

167
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,414
-Yeah.
-I came back to this moment
to catch him.

168
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,502
You should have.

169
00:09:50,546 --> 00:09:51,634
Brainy.

170
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,288
He's right.
I should've caught him.

171
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:54,811
By now he could've
hurt someone,

172
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,857
and if he hurts someone,
I don't think you understand.

173
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:00,687
My life is over.

174
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,734
Everything!
I will lose everything.
My wife, my daughter.

175
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:06,562
Wait.

176
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,912
You have a wife?
And a kid?

177
00:10:10,348 --> 00:10:12,568
Oh, my God, yes.
Yes. Uh...

178
00:10:14,788 --> 00:10:18,400
That's my wife, Aila.
Mary is gonna be two in April.

179
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:19,967
They're beautiful. I...

180
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:26,016
- Oh.
-It's so good to see you.

181
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,672
-I mean, I might've missed you,
like, just like a little bit.
-Yeah, me too.

182
00:10:29,716 --> 00:10:32,762
-But just...
-Yeah, well, I missed you,
like, a lot.

183
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:35,983
-It was really hard
leaving you guys.

184
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,288
So, what happened?

185
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:41,684
Well, I'd just finished
putting Mary to bed.

186
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:43,643
And then somebody's knocking
on the front door,

187
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,429
and I'm thinking,
please don't wake the baby up,
and then Aila is arguing,

188
00:10:47,472 --> 00:10:49,779
suddenly, with whoever it is,
defending me.

189
00:10:49,823 --> 00:10:53,174
So I run down there
to see what's happening,
and...

190
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,045
it's the time cops.

191
00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:00,181
Accusing me of killing
Chester Dunholtz on this date,
at this time.

192
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:01,922
But you didn't do it.

193
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,054
I told them that.

194
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:05,882
But they had my DNA

195
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:09,233
to prove it, so I'm thinking,
"Okay, this must be
some type of,

196
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:14,978
you know, doppelganger person
with my father's sick,
twisted brain.

197
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:19,722
And now, if this Toyman
kills someone, I will never
see my family again.

198
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:23,378
They'll put me in jail,
or worse, it's gonna affect
the timeline.

199
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,945
And I will have never met Aila.

200
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,339
Or my daughter.

201
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,167
Okay, all right.
We'll just... Okay.

202
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:32,343
Well, there must be something,
right? I mean...

203
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,998
okay, this person.

204
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,000
This person was found
lurking near Dunholtz,

205
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:39,089
so maybe they were
working together.

206
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:42,310
You know? I mean,
we've got a face.
Can we get an ID, Brainy?

207
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,445
Yeah, I'll, um,
I'll go to the DEO

208
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,753
and start cleaning up
the image to ID it,
tracking it.

209
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:54,452
I'll, uh, also put Winn's ship
in the DEO hangar
for safekeeping.

210
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:57,455
No, no, no, I do not want
the Legion ship
anywhere near Lex.

211
00:11:57,499 --> 00:11:59,762
You know what?
I've got an idea. I'll just
have to call an old friend.

212
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:03,766
Lex as in Lex Luthor, the hero?
Why would you not want
the Legion ship near him?

213
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,769
Uh, Lex is not a hero.

214
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:10,338
We're just gonna have J'onn
just bring you up to speed
on exactly what happened.

215
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,777
Thank you
for seeing me today.

216
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,344
I wanted to apologize to you

217
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:21,088
for how I treated you
after you took
my mother's medallion.

218
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,611
After all these years?

219
00:12:23,873 --> 00:12:24,874
Why now?

220
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,051
Andrea, I know about Leviathan.

221
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,188
Oh.

222
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:35,842
Lena...

223
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,151
I wanted to explain everything
to you for so long.

224
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:45,808
I know how dangerous
Leviathan is and how terrified
you must've been.

225
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,506
And I understand now
that you never wanted
to betray me.

226
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:50,813
No, it's been so hard.

227
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:54,817
I knew I had to protect you.
I'm so relieved
that you know the truth.

228
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:57,689
So am I.

229
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:02,346
And anything Leviathan
has asked you to do,
we will figure it out together.

230
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,435
They've never asked me
to do anything.

231
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,655
All these years,
and not a word?

232
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:08,962
They said
they would call on me,
but they never came.

233
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:12,879
I'm so sorry.

234
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:16,404
Hey, it's you and me again,
okay?

235
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,362
You jump, I jump.

236
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:22,453
If Leviathan calls you,
you come to me, okay?
I can't lose you again.

237
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,456
Okay.

238
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:31,027
Andrea knows nothing.

239
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:34,248
Seems on this Earth,
post-Crisis, Leviathan
hasn't activated her yet.

240
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,599
But don't worry, if they do,

241
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,732
I'll be the first person
she calls.

242
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:45,433
J'onn?

243
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,130
We're here.

244
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,959
Oh, this is nice!
Very Sam Spade.

245
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:52,222
-Never realized J'onn was
such an avid reader.
-Where is he?

246
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,615
I'm up here.

247
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,402
Is that a secret elevator?

248
00:14:00,622 --> 00:14:01,797
Don't push.

249
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:16,812
What is this place?

250
00:14:18,727 --> 00:14:20,511
In a minute. First...

251
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,775
I am so sorry.

252
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,256
But we will find this other you
and stop him.

253
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,911
Yeah. You always give
the best hugs, papa bear.

254
00:14:30,782 --> 00:14:32,045
Okay, J'onn. Just...

255
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:34,090
-You gotta tell us
about this place.
-Yeah!

256
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:37,180
Well, in the wake of Crisis,
Kara, Kal-El, Barry, Kate,

257
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,487
we established a headquarters
from which to fight crime.

258
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,576
Oh, in the future
they call it a Hall of Justice.

259
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:42,882
I like that.

260
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,362
I thought since Luthor Corp
now owns the DEO,

261
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:48,061
National City could use
its own collective.

262
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,934
A headquarters
to keep this city safe.

263
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:54,806
-To work outside of corporate
and government oversight.
- Huh.

264
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,983
Whose interests might not
always side with justice.

265
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,289
-So, like S.T.A.R. Labs?
-Or the Arrow bunker.

266
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:02,989
Place for my super friends
to work, whenever
they should need it.

267
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,120
What are you gonna call this?

268
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,601
I was thinking The Tower.

269
00:15:06,644 --> 00:15:09,473
-Cool!
-Absolutely.

270
00:15:09,517 --> 00:15:13,477
So, tell me what I missed
with this whole Crisis thing.

271
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:14,783
Not tell you.

272
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,307
-Show you.
-Ah.

273
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:19,266
But I must warn you.

274
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:22,834
The truth of the old Earth
could be quite upsetting.

275
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:25,881
Uh, not more upsetting
than what I'm already
dealing with, so

276
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,926
how bad can it be?

277
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,755
-Okay, get it out.

278
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,627
Get it all out. It's okay.

279
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:36,674
Whoa! Uh, so, wait,
Lena killed Lex?

280
00:15:36,718 --> 00:15:38,763
And then he came back to life?

281
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:42,680
And James runs a small town
newspaper and mentors children?
That's adorable!

282
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:43,943
And you!

283
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:45,988
-You were, what,
you were Russian?
-Yes.

284
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:48,251
Kasnian.
But that wasn't really me.

285
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,124
And so evil Lex
now owns the DEO?

286
00:15:51,167 --> 00:15:53,256
Yeah.

287
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,954
Oh, but let me tell you
about the doppelgangers
who came through a wormhole--

288
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,746
Not a bad picture of you.

289
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,400
I don't understand.

290
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:10,186
In every simulation I ran,
we always apprehended Toyman.

291
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,146
-He never got away.
-What I don't understand
is why you're here

292
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:14,930
and the Legion ship is not.

293
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:21,284
Director Danvers thought
it would be safer to
secure the ship

294
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:24,548
at a government black site
three miles south
of the National City border.

295
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:27,116
Thank you.
And once I get there,
how do I access

296
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,205
what the ship knows
about Leviathan?

297
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,599
There is a panel
on the right quadrant.

298
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:35,559
You have Winn Schott's DNA
from his hair.
That's all you'll need.

299
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:37,692
Now, our mission is over.

300
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,476
Call off Toyman.

301
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,478
Does he look like
my personal attack dog?

302
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:44,003
He's underground.
Toyboy is smarter
than we gave him credit for.

303
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:50,400
-Toyman will strike again.
-Then get out there
with your little do-good crew

304
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:51,575
and take care of it.

305
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:57,451
Hello, National City!

306
00:16:57,494 --> 00:17:01,890
Well, by now
you might've heard that my splashy show at Toycon

307
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:05,241
caused, well,
a little bit of ruckus.

308
00:17:05,285 --> 00:17:06,895
J'onn, can you track
his location?

309
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:10,116
He's blocked his IP address
and signal.

310
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,033
Whatever technology he's using,
it's something
that I've never seen before.

311
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,166
And I have got
a bigger bang in mind.

312
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:20,169
Now, tell me.
Have you ever been

313
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:24,739
so unfairly wronged
that it just made you wanna

314
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,349
burn it all down?

315
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,830
Well, I have.

316
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,745
And I'm angry.

317
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:33,965
Someone hurt my family

318
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:37,230
and they destroyed
my father's good name.

319
00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,275
-Look at that.

320
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,842
People are supporting him.

321
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:43,192
-He's collecting followers.
- So,

322
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:47,327
I have the target,
I have the method,
and what I need now...

323
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:48,937
is you.

324
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,113
Give me the will.

325
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:55,117
Like me, subscribe, share,
follow me, and once I reach

326
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,815
one million followers,

327
00:17:57,859 --> 00:18:01,471
you will see
a fireworks display

328
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:04,866
like never before.
So, let's play to win!

329
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,737
Huh?

330
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:07,869
Until next time.

331
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:10,611
I am hashtag

332
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,526
Toyman.

333
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:18,532
Uh, guys?

334
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,625
If he wins, I'm dead.

335
00:18:31,545 --> 00:18:33,938
I can't believe
all these people
are rooting for violence.

336
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,375
Well, the anonymity
of the internet

337
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,333
brings out everyone's
basest instincts.

338
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,380
Sure,
but how would those people feel
if they were the target?

339
00:18:40,423 --> 00:18:43,600
Unfortunately,
this is a distinctly
21st century problem.

340
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:47,996
By, what, 2126,
anti-trolling legislations
are in place around the world.

341
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,519
-Stopped World War Three.
-Huh?

342
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,869
I should not
have told you that. Whoa.

343
00:18:51,913 --> 00:18:53,697
I'll go sweep the city.

344
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,351
See what I can find
in the real world.

345
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,920
If you need me, just call.

346
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,141
J'onn, that's genius!

347
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:06,884
Director Danvers,
I got your call.

348
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:10,061
Yes, this place is genius.

349
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,064
Brainy, I'm glad
that you're here.

350
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,938
Look, the Toyman is using
some sort of IP address blocker
from his world,

351
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:20,420
-and we just can't--
-I know. I've been trying
to track him from the DEO.

352
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,945
Have you had any luck
identifying Toyman's accomplice
from that image?

353
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:27,949
The image was too obscure
to get a clear ID.

354
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,603
Well, we might have something
on board the Legion ship that
can help enhance the image--

355
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,431
-I said I'd do it.

356
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:34,825
And I will.

357
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:39,917
Andrea needs me.
I have to go to CatCo.

358
00:19:39,961 --> 00:19:41,615
I'll call you if anything pops.

359
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,057
-Kara.
-Huh?

360
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:53,975
I think there's a connection
between Lex and Toyman.

361
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:55,629
Actually, yeah. Um,

362
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,239
-I need to talk to you
about that--
-When the DEO put Toycon

363
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:59,241
on lockdown,
Lex had just slipped up.

364
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:02,244
Okay, I believe that Lex
is not who he says he is.

365
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,463
But...

366
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:05,595
that means we have to be smart,
because

367
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,468
if he's dangerous,
we can't just go around
making baseless accusations--

368
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:12,646
Kara, we're reporters.
We dig into hunches,
no matter the risk.

369
00:20:12,689 --> 00:20:14,952
Kara.

370
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:18,782
When I call you in
for a meeting, I expect you
to come directly to me.

371
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:22,264
-Mmm-hmm.
-William, I need you
with me today.

372
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,788
My father's alma mater
is honoring the family

373
00:20:24,832 --> 00:20:27,530
for our advancement
in tech and entertainment.

374
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:31,273
I'm going to announce
the next phase of
Obsidian VR at the event.

375
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:34,276
Obsidian Platinum will be
like nothing anyone
has ever seen before.

376
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,104
William, I want you
to cover it.

377
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,801
-I'd rather not--
-That's a great idea.

378
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,543
-Thank you, Kara.
-It's a good idea.

379
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:42,153
And I have something special
for you too.

380
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:43,807
Okay.

381
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,766
You were friends
with Winn Schott
when he worked for CatCo,

382
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,290
before disappearing
two years ago, right?

383
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,118
Uh, yes.

384
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,338
Mmm, bet you never thought
he'd reappear with
such an evil splash.

385
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:55,210
I'd like an exclusive.
Immediately.

386
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,603
No!

387
00:20:56,646 --> 00:20:58,126
Um,

388
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:01,347
I'm sorry. No!
That is not
the Winn Schott I know,

389
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,523
and I will not give a platform
to a madman.

390
00:21:03,566 --> 00:21:06,482
Toyman already has a platform.

391
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:10,704
His video went viral
across five continents
in under an hour.

392
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:12,749
We have to capitalize
on that kind of traffic.

393
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:16,144
We don't have
to promote bloodshed for
the sake of your bottom line.

394
00:21:16,187 --> 00:21:19,060
Actually, according
to your paycheck,

395
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,367
yes, you do.

396
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,457
William, be ready in an hour.

397
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,719
Kara,

398
00:21:25,762 --> 00:21:27,111
get me that exclusive.

399
00:21:33,553 --> 00:21:35,337
You should see me now, Father.

400
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:39,036
Ha! On our Earth,
they called you a psychopath,
but here,

401
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,561
they cheer for me.

402
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:48,394
And yes, it may be too late
for you, Father, but soon

403
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,222
I will accomplish
what you could not.

404
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,746
What you always dreamed of.

405
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:56,924
I will live forever.

406
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:09,937
Wait, this is
the superhero-level stuff
I have been waiting for.

407
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,373
Wait, Nia, Nia,
wait, come here.

408
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,548
Sorry.

409
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:14,420
Winn, this is Nia.

410
00:22:14,463 --> 00:22:16,552
-Hello.
-Whoa, Nia.

411
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,075
As in Nia Nal?

412
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:19,947
Yeah?

413
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:22,732
Wow, wow.
This is incredible. Holy...

414
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:26,432
-Hi.
-I'm sorry, your great,
great, great, great, great...

415
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:29,870
bunch of greats granddaughter,
Nura Nal, is, like,
one of my best friends

416
00:22:29,913 --> 00:22:31,741
and, like, the most
kick-ass Legionnaire.

417
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:36,093
-That's crazy.
Tell me everything.

418
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:38,008
Does she look like me?

419
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:40,924
Okay, wait.
Let's save story time until
after we catch the bad guy.

420
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:42,491
Right. Well, anything to help.

421
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,319
Okay.

422
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,582
Once he's hit
a million followers,
he's promised to strike.

423
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:47,975
So, you'll have to work fast.

424
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:52,980
She can do it.

425
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,593
Um, right. So,
are there any markers,

426
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:00,117
any specifics I can keep
an eye out for?

427
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:02,119
All we know
is that he wants attention.

428
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:04,426
Attention. Okay.

429
00:23:15,524 --> 00:23:19,267
Not you. Get out
of my head, jerk.

430
00:23:24,011 --> 00:23:25,534
- It's okay.

431
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:26,622
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

432
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,667
What did you see?

433
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,065
-Nothing.
- Literally nothing?

434
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:37,459
That seems unlikely.

435
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:38,895
Fine.

436
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,202
I saw a tiger.

437
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,161
Wildcat.

438
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,516
Um, let me.

439
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:57,479
Hi.

440
00:23:59,133 --> 00:24:00,439
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

441
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,049
It's just...

442
00:24:03,746 --> 00:24:05,226
my mind's been
a little messy lately.

443
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,881
It's okay.

444
00:24:07,924 --> 00:24:11,667
Do you mind telling me
exactly what you did see?

445
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:14,583
It's just that Nura taught me
how to interpret dreams.

446
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,324
I'm kinda like her Watson.

447
00:24:18,239 --> 00:24:22,199
I saw my ex-boyfriend
turn into a tiger
and attack me.

448
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:28,336
Wildcat was my nickname
for Brainy.

449
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,946
-Oh, I know.

450
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:36,213
I just thought
I was better

451
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:37,737
than letting him get
in my head.

452
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:43,830
You know,
I can't tell you a whole lot
about the future,

453
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,789
but I can tell you

454
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,487
that you,

455
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,532
Nia,

456
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:53,448
are a powerful woman.

457
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:56,407
You see this?

458
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,627
So, I'm the only human
Legionnaire,

459
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:02,762
so when I got my Legion ring,
they had to soup it up
with, like, some cool powers.

460
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:12,162
-Is that dream energy?
-Yeah.

461
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:15,731
So, Nura and I,
we fashioned the ring's
abilities after her and

462
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:18,299
your powers.

463
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,173
Never let anyone

464
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:25,480
make you question
your own worth.

465
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,701
Okay.

466
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:31,399
And that is patented Nura Nal
advice. She would kill me
if I didn't give her credit.

467
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:38,841
Thanks, Winn.

468
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,277
-You're right.
-I know.

469
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,801
I'm gonna try again.

470
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:48,329
You must be such a great dad.

471
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,592
I try.

472
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,507
-Oh.

473
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,380
It's, like, the hardest thing
that I have ever done.

474
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,426
-I bet.
-I'm not kidding.

475
00:25:58,469 --> 00:26:02,865
Yes, it's like, I became a dad,
and suddenly my heart
was just...

476
00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:06,434
on the outside of my body.
You know?

477
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:10,438
She's also my greatest
accomplishment, my little Mary.

478
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:13,484
She's my legacy.

479
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,486
Did you name her
after your mom?

480
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,749
Well, it was either that
or Winifred.

481
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,621
Kara was an option.

482
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,971
-What?
-Yeah, Aila pushed for it.

483
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,756
But if I'm being honest, um,

484
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:27,673
in the future,
Kara isn't exactly
what you would call

485
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,631
an original name choice.

486
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,154
What are you talking about?

487
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:32,591
Parents naming their children

488
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,636
-after the legendary
Kara Zor-El.
-Oh, my gosh.

489
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:39,075
-No, I like Mary.

490
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,207
Yeah, me too.

491
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:45,299
Besides, I'm not too hot
on my own
legend right now.

492
00:26:47,214 --> 00:26:49,999
Lex threatened to kill
one of my co-workers

493
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,393
if I don't stop him
from investigating Lex.

494
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,747
So, either I go against
my journalistic ethics or...

495
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,662
or I put William in danger.

496
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:03,230
Don't know how
to tell you this,

497
00:27:04,492 --> 00:27:08,365
but you put me in danger,
like, every day.

498
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:11,673
-No, no, don't say that.
- No, you did.
No, listen, it doesn't matter.

499
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:13,501
It doesn't matter though.

500
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,546
Because I knew that
you were always gonna be there
to protect me.

501
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,765
You're Supergirl.

502
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:19,942
Being in your orbit, it's...

503
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:21,640
inspiring.

504
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:27,471
Oh, oh,

505
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:28,951
oh, why didn't I think
of this before?

506
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:30,736
Toyman!

507
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,042
He said that he is doing
everything for his father.

508
00:27:33,086 --> 00:27:34,870
But his father didn't exist
on this Earth.

509
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,785
But mine did.

510
00:27:36,829 --> 00:27:40,180
And so, if I was gonna go
be inspired by my father,
where would I work?

511
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:42,965
We're too late.
If Toyman was here,
he's gone now.

512
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:44,924
Guys.

513
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,665
I think I found something.

514
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:49,493
Andrea and her father?

515
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,713
My dad had a board
just like this for Dunholtz.

516
00:27:51,757 --> 00:27:53,802
So, on Toyman's Earth,

517
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:57,066
the Rojases must've had
something to do with the fall
of Winslow Schott, Sr.

518
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,899
We have to get to CatCo.
We have to warn Andrea.

519
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,901
She's not at CatCo.
She's at...

520
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:08,121
National City University
with William.

521
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,124
Home of the Tigers.

522
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:48,291
Wow! Aren't you handsome?

523
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:50,554
We're connected now,

524
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:51,642
aren't we?

525
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:52,948
Precisely.

526
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:55,777
I'm now directly linked
to your consciousness.

527
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,300
Then you know what I want.

528
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,345
Give it to me.

529
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:05,569
Hold.

530
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,354
Enhance.

531
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,183
I know you.

532
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:13,664
How do I know you?

533
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,014
Search for this woman.

534
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:18,626
Oh.

535
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,628
Of course.

536
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,679
At Obsidian,

537
00:29:28,723 --> 00:29:31,682
we staked our reputation
on pushing technology
to the limits.

538
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,815
Imagine a world

539
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,165
where, after you've come back
from work,

540
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:40,779
you slip on your Obsidian
Platinum contact lenses,
and suddenly

541
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:45,174
you're on a Tuscan villa,
surrounded by
your beautiful vineyard.

542
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:48,612
You set a large family table
out on your verandah

543
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:52,181
where you let the wine
from your own label flow.

544
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:58,622
Later, you can bottle the wine
from your vineyard and sell it
for real money.

545
00:29:59,536 --> 00:30:01,887
With Obsidian Platinum,

546
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,587
you will never again
have to choose between
your life and your dream.

547
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:11,505
-You can always have both.

548
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:17,337
Smile!

549
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:37,836
Kitty number two!

550
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,673
Will, where are you?

551
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,461
I got him!

552
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,646
My powers can do that?

553
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,055
Go after Toyman.
I've got this.

554
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,972
Here, kitty, kitty cat.

555
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,802
Are you trying to tame
a robot tiger?

556
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:34,327
If the chair fits.

557
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,464
Stop!

558
00:31:41,508 --> 00:31:42,552
Says who?

559
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,473
Whoa, where did you come from?

560
00:31:50,517 --> 00:31:51,997
Yet another Earth?

561
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,433
Actually, no,

562
00:31:53,476 --> 00:31:55,087
this is my Earth.

563
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,220
-This is my life, and you are
really messing it...
-Whoa!

564
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,181
Give me the trigger.

565
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:04,357
Uh, well, that would be no fun.

566
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,968
Is the bomb in the van?

567
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:08,927
-Hmm.
-Listen to me,

568
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,538
I know what it feels like
to wanna protect your family.
Believe me, I do.

569
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:14,584
But you have also got to
create your own legacy.

570
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:18,588
This is my legacy.

571
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,155
You've seen the people.
They adore me.

572
00:32:20,199 --> 00:32:21,591
Dude, this isn't love.

573
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,159
No, you're just a cheap thrill
for them, all right?

574
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:25,726
Give me, give me the trigger.

575
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:29,295
Can't. It's a dead man's switch
for a dead man, like me.

576
00:32:29,338 --> 00:32:31,514
Just stop that.
You could still change.

577
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,039
All right? You are not Toyman.

578
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:35,997
You say that name Toyman

579
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:40,349
with such disdain, but you,
you do not understand.

580
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,486
Toyman is eternal.

581
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:24,219
Have you seen William?

582
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:25,568
He was supposed to be here.

583
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:28,745
I ran diagnostics.

584
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:31,052
We lost no civilian lives
to any of Toyman's attacks.

585
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,793
Well, that's good news.

586
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:34,795
Speaking of news,
I wonder what the news
is like in the future.

587
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,061
Hey!

588
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,497
It's all over.

589
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,370
Have you looked at
the wanted poster?

590
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,077
It's gone.

591
00:33:58,862 --> 00:34:00,473
I know.

592
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,739
Will, where are you?

593
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,436
You're not gonna believe
what I saw.

594
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,439
You were supposed to
be at the university,
and you weren't.

595
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:12,528
I know how important
this story is to you,

596
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:15,705
and that you won't let anything
stand in the way of
you getting it, even me,

597
00:34:15,749 --> 00:34:18,360
but I also know
that Lex would sooner
take someone out

598
00:34:18,404 --> 00:34:20,754
than let a headline be run
that threatens his reputation.

599
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:23,365
-And I'm not--
-Which is why
I have been thinking,

600
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:26,977
we should investigate
Lex together.

601
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:29,545
There's safety
in numbers and...

602
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:32,766
and if we share information,

603
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:35,029
we have a better chance
at exposing him,
once and for all.

604
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,466
You mean we'd be like...

605
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:39,642
-partners?
-Exactly!

606
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,514
Yes, who would have
each other's back.

607
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:43,951
Well then,

608
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,300
partner,

609
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:48,173
I think you need to see this.

610
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:54,004
My sister showed me
this hangar before, it's

611
00:34:54,048 --> 00:34:57,312
-high government security.
How did--
-Lex get in?

612
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,575
-He paid off the guards.

613
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:01,273
- He's got a plan.
- And we need
to find out what it is.

614
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:02,665
Well, he didn't see you,
did he?

615
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:03,927
-Of course not.
-Good.

616
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:04,885
I was careful.

617
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,932
So, do you wanna take a look
at the rest of my notes?

618
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:16,418
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
I totally forgot
what time it is.

619
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:17,637
I have to go.

620
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,161
-Big date?
-The biggest! It's game night.

621
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:24,557
You should come.

622
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,385
Uh, nah.

623
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:28,430
-You know, I'm not very good
at games.
-That doesn't matter, it's--

624
00:35:28,474 --> 00:35:33,261
-Besides, I have dinner
waiting for me, so--
-No!

625
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,176
-Mmm-mmm?
-Uh-uh.

626
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,964
Under no circumstances
will I let you stay here
and eat that...

627
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:43,445
-Well, that's the saddest
sandwich I've ever seen.

628
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:44,533
Come on.

629
00:35:44,577 --> 00:35:46,056
-No! That stays.
-Okay.

630
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:51,497
Is there not a game night
that you should be attending?

631
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,803
Oh, there is.

632
00:35:53,847 --> 00:35:56,850
But I don't really stand
much of a chance without
my Trivial Pursuitpartner.

633
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,681
Sadly, I cannot partake.

634
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:04,466
J'onn has asked me to upgrade
the diagnostic system.

635
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,989
No, he didn't.

636
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,296
Brainy.

637
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,211
What is going on? Hmm?

638
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:13,823
Dude, I saw the way
that you looked at Nia,
when the tigers attacked.

639
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:17,000
That fear of losing someone
that you love. I've had
that same look on my face

640
00:36:17,044 --> 00:36:18,524
since I got to this time.

641
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,047
So, tell me the truth.

642
00:36:21,527 --> 00:36:22,615
I...

643
00:36:23,616 --> 00:36:24,965
have lied...

644
00:36:26,706 --> 00:36:28,316
to everyone...

645
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:31,580
because I'd...

646
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,369
I've had to work
with Lex Luthor.

647
00:36:37,412 --> 00:36:38,674
I helped Lex

648
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:39,936
bring you back

649
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,025
for the sake of the future.

650
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,464
-That was you? You--
-Winn--

651
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:49,598
-No, no, you risked my life.
-I...

652
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:52,688
-Brainy, my family!
-I had to, I...

653
00:36:52,732 --> 00:36:56,039
It was imperative
that Lex get information

654
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,738
from the memory cube

655
00:36:58,781 --> 00:37:00,130
on your ship.

656
00:37:00,174 --> 00:37:01,306
I did the calculations.

657
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:02,785
I knew no one would die.

658
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:04,613
That we would catch Toyman,
the...

659
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:08,791
The one thing I didn't account
for was Lex himself.
He's, he's...

660
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:12,012
chaos incarnate.
He's completely unpredictable,
and I...

661
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,711
I don't know
if I can control him.

662
00:37:18,192 --> 00:37:19,193
Winn, I...

663
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:23,153
I'm so sorry.

664
00:37:23,197 --> 00:37:27,288
Another Brainiac told me
that it was absolutely critical

665
00:37:27,332 --> 00:37:29,986
that I help Lex
in complete secrecy.

666
00:37:30,596 --> 00:37:32,859
But I hate it.

667
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,515
I hurt Nia.

668
00:37:38,473 --> 00:37:42,869
And all I want is to be
close with her again, but...

669
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:45,872
I have to be cold.

670
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,572
And...

671
00:37:50,616 --> 00:37:55,534
I'm terrified
that I'm becoming the bad guy.

672
00:37:57,536 --> 00:37:58,885
You must hate me.

673
00:38:00,147 --> 00:38:01,366
You're right.

674
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,457
I should hate you.

675
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:07,676
But...

676
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,418
everything worked out, so...

677
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:14,335
I guess I don't.

678
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,906
In fact...

679
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:25,390
In a way, you kinda helped me.

680
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:29,698
Growing up,
I was constantly burdened
by my father's crimes.

681
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:33,049
You know, son of a madman.
Pretty sure everybody
judged me for it.

682
00:38:33,093 --> 00:38:36,662
Everything I've done in my life
has been in defiance of that.
Joining the super friends,

683
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:39,055
running out to the future
with Legionnaires to

684
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:40,622
fight your cousin and stop him.

685
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:44,974
But all that kinda...

686
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,673
pales in comparison to

687
00:38:48,891 --> 00:38:50,240
saving my own future.

688
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,679
Plus, I got to see
some old friends.

689
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,378
You still consider me a...

690
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:58,727
an old friend?

691
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:00,163
Yes,

692
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:02,209
Brainy. I do.

693
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,998
Oh, shoot.

694
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,349
I'm running late. Uh, you sure
you don't wanna come?

695
00:39:13,655 --> 00:39:14,961
I have work to do.

696
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,239
Pick it up.

697
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:33,327
Press the button.

698
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,339
Now, think of what you want.

699
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:52,781
Q-waves.

700
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,827
As promised.

701
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,611
They do exist on this Earth.

702
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,961
All we had to do was
bring them to this time.

703
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,223
Happy birthday, Christmas,

704
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,573
and New Year, little sis.

705
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:04,663
-Thank you for going to Andrea

706
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:05,881
today.

707
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,579
What are partners for?

708
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,843
If only Mother could see
how nicely we're playing
together now.

709
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,802
Let's not ruin the streak.

710
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:23,246
- Ohh!

711
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,644
I don't know how
she's doing it,
but she's cheating.

712
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,733
- Check her sleeves.
I saw something.
-Wait.

713
00:40:31,777 --> 00:40:33,822
Aw, there's our girl.
She's feeling better.

714
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,215
But, like, for real this time.

715
00:40:35,258 --> 00:40:36,608
A lot better than you
at Jenga.

716
00:40:38,784 --> 00:40:40,786
-Okay, well, wait,
'cause it's my turn now.

717
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,484
Ready, set...

718
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:45,312
- She's terrible.
- Go!

719
00:40:45,355 --> 00:40:46,792
- She's terrible.
She's terrible.

720
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:48,533
Ohh...

721
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,754
-Dude!

722
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:55,061
The point is for the tower
not to fall, am I wrong?

723
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,671
Marty, is this how you play
in Metropolis?

724
00:40:56,715 --> 00:40:58,934
- No!
-Love your glasses, by the way.

725
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:00,675
Thank you! These,
they're prescription.

726
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:01,850
Yes.

727
00:41:01,894 --> 00:41:03,722
And those are the rules, but,

728
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:08,117
uh, we play that if it falls,
we take a shot,
so I'm just gonna...

729
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:12,034
Wait, wait, wait.
A toast, a toast.

730
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:14,515
To new friends.

731
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:16,778
- Aw.
- Welcome.

732
00:41:16,822 --> 00:41:19,694
And to old friends.
May they always find their way
back to us.

733
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:22,436
-Aw!
- Cheers!

734
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,532
That's the last
of Toyman's evidence.

735
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,186
Let's lock it up
for the night.

736
00:41:43,805 --> 00:41:46,547
Let's play to win!
