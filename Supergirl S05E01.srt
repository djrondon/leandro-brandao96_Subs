1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,698
Previously on
Supergirl...

2
00:00:02,741 --> 00:00:04,656
Now, it is time,
you avenge yourself

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,484
against the brother
who wronged you.

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,791
-Eve.
-Sorry, not sorry.

5
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:11,794
Can you believe the fourth
estate saved the day?

6
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:16,059
Kara Danvers
is Supergirl.

7
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:19,236
Your friends have been
lying to you.

8
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,679
Damn it. The brakes.

9
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,424
Help us! Help!

10
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,827
Thanks, Supergirl.

11
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,438
When I grow up,
I wanna be just like you.

12
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,788
Oh, that's easy,
you just have to fight
for what's right

13
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,616
and always tell
the truth.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,923
Always tell the truth,
that's rich.

15
00:00:54,445 --> 00:00:55,533
Ms. Luthor,

16
00:00:56,621 --> 00:00:57,622
is everything all right?

17
00:00:57,666 --> 00:00:58,754
Why so formal?

18
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,104
I thought
we were best friends.

19
00:01:01,974 --> 00:01:02,801
Kara.

20
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,196
-You know?
-Know what?

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,980
That you're a hypocrite
who's been lying to me
for years?

22
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:09,069
-No, Lena, I didn't--

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,727
Terminate.

24
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:20,036
Virtual reality
simulation terminated.

25
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,259
May I ask you something,
Ms. Luthor?

26
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:26,825
Yes, Hope.

27
00:01:28,436 --> 00:01:30,438
These simulations you've been
running in virtual reality.

28
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,657
My calculations
show it's possible

29
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,572
they can be achieved
in the real world.

30
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,748
Are you offering
to help me kill Supergirl?

31
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,056
Yes. Would you like me
to facilitate?

32
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,971
I appreciate
the offer, Hope.

33
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:45,148
You grow more intelligent
and capable by the day.

34
00:01:45,975 --> 00:01:49,065
And your assistance comes
without ambition,
drama, or ego.

35
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,633
-That's why you built me.
-Precisely.

36
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,810
Because I trust in technology,
not people.

37
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:57,682
People are governed
by feelings.

38
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:01,904
Anger, hurt, sadness,
and I'm guilty of that too.

39
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:05,516
That's why I engage
in these simulations,

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,605
to excise these emotions.

41
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:10,826
I'm not a villain.

42
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,743
I don't want to kill Supergirl,
I just want her to experience

43
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,919
the same hurt
she inflicted on me.

44
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:19,051
And soon enough she will.

45
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,507
-Pardon me.
-Whoa!

46
00:02:41,073 --> 00:02:43,075
Thought I was gonna be late,
but looks like I turned up

47
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,076
just at the right time.

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,991
What is going on
with these people?

49
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:48,037
-They're completely oblivious.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,170
I would say that
they were Slattorians.

51
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:52,955
A race of aliens I came across
during an investigation.

52
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:57,220
Oh, your PI powers of deduction
are failing you, J'onn J'onzz.

53
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:59,570
The silver eyes
are courtesy of Obsidian North.

54
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:01,137
Isn't that the company
you're working for, Kelly?

55
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,878
Today is
my official first day.

56
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,794
Those are augmented
reality contact lenses

57
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:08,100
that we're beta testing.
The people with the silver eyes

58
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:10,364
that are staring at the void
above the cashier?

59
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,930
They're actually
looking at a virtual menu.

60
00:03:11,974 --> 00:03:13,105
I'll show you.

61
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:14,803
So when you wear
the contact lenses,

62
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:17,414
you're linked
to tons of people
on a social media platform,

63
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,329
and they can connect
without saying a word.

64
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:20,939
Kind of like you and me.

65
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,463
You guys are so cute.

66
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:25,466
But those contact lenses
creep me out.

67
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,946
Just call me when you can
register to vote

68
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,121
with a gesture.

69
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,688
'Cause, look, there's about

70
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,124
to be a special election,

71
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:34,126
and did you know that
voter registration is down?

72
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,476
People don't wanna
pay attention

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,999
to what's happening
in the real world.

74
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,001
Yeah, but, you know,
some good things
have happened

75
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:41,656
since your article came out
and took down President Baker,

76
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:42,874
exposed Lex Luthor.

77
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,441
And somebody...

78
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,705
is being presented
with a Pulitzer tomorrow

79
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,446
'cause you're the one
that helped make it happen.

80
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,449
It does feel good
to have my work recognized,

81
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,321
but I just thought
after Baker was ousted,

82
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:56,453
more people would be hungry

83
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,412
and ready to fight
for social change.

84
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:00,283
And now it just seems like

85
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,154
everyone's hiding behind
their gadgets.

86
00:04:02,198 --> 00:04:03,982
Technology does
a lot of good too, Kara.

87
00:04:04,026 --> 00:04:07,116
In my new job, I am going to be
using Obsidian's VR tech

88
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,293
to heal the brains
of dementia and PTSD patients.

89
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,818
Touche. I'm a curmudgeon.
Your new job sounds amazing,

90
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:16,386
and I'm so glad we're working
in the same building.

91
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,040
Big Belly Burger lunches.

92
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,172
Ooh, look at
the time. I gotta fly, guys.

93
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:22,044
I'm teaching a Tai Chi class
to a group of kids.

94
00:04:22,087 --> 00:04:23,437
Oh,
that's wonderful, J'onn.

95
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,482
Yeah, I'm living
with clarity and purpose.

96
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,528
-It's gonna be great.
-You know what
would not be great

97
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,094
is me being late
for my first day.

98
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,487
-No.
-Okay, I gotta run, bye.

99
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,141
-Bye.
-Bye.

100
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,449
Hey, how did it go
with Lena last night?

101
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:36,841
-I mean, I'm dying to hear.

102
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:39,540
Oh, no, I know that face.

103
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,672
Are you ser-- You didn't say
anything? You didn't tell her?

104
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,892
It's not my fault,
I had to take the dog
to the vet.

105
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,242
You don't have a dog, Kara.

106
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,200
My neighbor's dog.
Mrs. Stein.

107
00:04:48,244 --> 00:04:50,551
-Oh, come on.
-She needed my help.

108
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,509
You have to tell Lena
that you're Supergirl,

109
00:04:52,553 --> 00:04:54,206
-but--
-When I told you to hold off,

110
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,643
I just meant for one night.

111
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:57,384
But there's been
so much going on.

112
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,821
I'm covering
the special election,

113
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:02,519
and with the dog,
and I'm helping you

114
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:04,956
recover all those prisoners
from the DEO desert facility.

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,916
And the DEO and I
very much appreciate that.

116
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,918
But you're doing all
these other things

117
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,312
when there's just one thing
that you need to do.

118
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,576
I know.

119
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,709
I've just put it off
for so long,

120
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:21,364
and now...

121
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,061
I'm being given an award

122
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:25,542
for my tireless pursuit
of the truth,

123
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,804
and I'm a liar.

124
00:05:28,502 --> 00:05:30,895
-I'm terrible.
-You're not terrible.

125
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:32,244
You're just scared.

126
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:33,768
I am so scared.

127
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,554
I'm so scared that
she's never gonna
forgive me, Alex.

128
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,296
I mean what kind of person
lies to their best friend

129
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
for this long?

130
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:43,255
Look, I...

131
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,606
have told you
a gazillion times,

132
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,434
you are the bravest person
that I know.

133
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:50,872
Okay? So, be brave
and tell her.

134
00:05:51,176 --> 00:05:52,264
You're right.

135
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,615
Yeah, we're having lunch
today,

136
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:56,094
-I'll tell her today.
-Good.

137
00:05:56,138 --> 00:05:57,444
I believe in you.

138
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:01,622
-No, Hannibal Lecter,
he eats people.
-Miranda Priestly.

139
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,406
Miranda Priestly?
Are you serious?

140
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,148
I'm as serious
as the pursed lips
of Miranda Priestly.

141
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,933
Okay, good,
you guys can help me
prove a point.

142
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,761
Who is is the greatest
movie villain of all time?

143
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:12,197
- Voldemort.
- Hans Gruber.

144
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,548
Impressively unhelpful.

145
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,116
Well, I guess you'll just
have to accept
that I'm right.

146
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,683
Hmm. This Earth custom

147
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,424
that the girlfriend
is always right

148
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:24,427
is illogical and frustrating,

149
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:26,821
but I can assimilate.

150
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,563
Are you ready for work,
Agent Dox?

151
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,478
-Right beside you,
Director Danvers.
-Great.

152
00:06:31,782 --> 00:06:33,436
-Bye, Brainy.
-Bye, Nia.

153
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,655
Oh.

154
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,094
Sorry.

155
00:06:39,137 --> 00:06:40,965
-Let's go, Nia.
-Let's go.

156
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:44,795
Now, listen, guys,
I don't care if it's 500
or 5,000 words,

157
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,536
the most important thing
that we can do

158
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,320
is to report everything

159
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,583
that we can find
on each candidate.

160
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,412
That way our readers
can make an informed decision.

161
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,850
And if you dive deep,
maybe you too

162
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:57,591
can win a Pulitzer.

163
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,172
-Hi.
-Hi.

164
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,826
Hello, uh,
can I help you?

165
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:18,089
Not unless you brought
a light meter.

166
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,528
This office is in dire need
of solar window treatments.

167
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,181
I'm sorry, who are you?

168
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:25,053
Oh, my God,
I am so rude.

169
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:26,663
Andrea Rojas.
And you?

170
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:27,664
Kara Danvers.

171
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,318
Kara? Such a pleasure.

172
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,321
-I'm a big fan.
- Oh, that's
very kind of you.

173
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,804
And did you say Rojas,
as in Obsidian North?

174
00:07:36,847 --> 00:07:37,979
The one and only.

175
00:07:38,022 --> 00:07:40,285
Right, uh, well, I'm sorry,
Ms. Rojas,

176
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,374
I think the elevator
dropped you off
on the wrong floor.

177
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:43,854
Obsidian's one down.

178
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,378
Oh, my goodness.

179
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,380
Lena didn't tell you,
did she?

180
00:07:48,424 --> 00:07:50,295
-Didn't tell her what?
- James Olsen.

181
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,950
I am glad you're here.
I'm a big admirer of yours.

182
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,388
So don't think for
one moment that I won't
find a place for you here.

183
00:07:57,781 --> 00:08:01,263
Find a place for me here?

184
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,438
I bought CatCo.

185
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:05,223
Actually, I bought
the whole building,

186
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,921
but CatCo is
the major acquisition.

187
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,706
And I'm taking over
as editor-in-chief.

188
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:15,669
Welcome to the Lost World
of Krypton exhibit.

189
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,931
-Go ahead, take a look.

190
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,238
Now, many of these items
were generously donated

191
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,805
by Supergirl and Superman,

192
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:24,808
including the pod
that Superman flew
to Earth in as a baby.

193
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,027
Isn't that cool?

194
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:30,031
Okay, now who wants
to experience

195
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,773
the Phantom Zone?

196
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,949
Where time does not pass?

197
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:37,342
Okay, come on,
everybody, follow me.

198
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:41,782
Hey, kiddo.

199
00:08:42,826 --> 00:08:44,132
Hey, come on
and join us.

200
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,569
What are you doing?

201
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:55,839
What?

202
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:00,931
Kara.

203
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:02,933
Finally. It's been ages.

204
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,240
Hey, is everything okay
at CatCo?

205
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,111
I have six missed calls
from James.

206
00:09:07,155 --> 00:09:08,504
Actually...

207
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,420
Andrea Rojas showed up
in his office

208
00:09:11,463 --> 00:09:14,336
about a half an hour ago
saying she bought CatCo?

209
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:17,339
-Why would she do that?
-Oh, thank God.

210
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:20,603
I told James
and Nia there must have
been a huge mistake.

211
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:22,431
It's not a mistake,
Kara, I...

212
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:24,738
sold CatCo to Andrea.

213
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,870
She wasn't supposed
to show up till tomorrow

214
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,568
after you and I
had had lunch.

215
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,660
You sold CatCo
without telling any of us?

216
00:09:33,703 --> 00:09:35,749
To be honest, Kara,
I only bought the company

217
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:37,664
because I knew
how much it meant to you,

218
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:40,667
and it's frankly left me
strapped for capital,

219
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,843
which I desperately
need for a new venture

220
00:09:42,886 --> 00:09:44,671
that I'm working on.

221
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,281
When Andrea called,
it was just too good
of an offer to pass up.

222
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,849
I... I had no idea...

223
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,635
-I completely understand.
-Andrea and I go way back.

224
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,289
I mean, since boarding school.

225
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,770
And she is a brilliant
business woman.

226
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:59,163
I would not have sold her
CatCo if I didn't think
she would do a great job.

227
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,600
Oh, of course.

228
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,646
Why didn't you tell me
beforehand?

229
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,865
I was a coward.

230
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:08,085
And I hope that
you don't feel like

231
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,652
I made you out to be
too much of a fool

232
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,088
by keeping you
in the dark.

233
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,352
-No.
-You're my best friend,

234
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,658
and here I go,
once again

235
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:18,052
proving that you are
more virtuous than I am.

236
00:10:18,095 --> 00:10:20,576
But I never did purport
to be a saint.

237
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:25,320
I've ordered some lunch in.
It should be arriving soon.

238
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,365
Why don't you fill me in?
I mean, how are you?

239
00:10:27,409 --> 00:10:30,064
-How have you been?
-Oh, I've, um...

240
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,198
You know what,
actually there is something

241
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:37,158
I wanna talk
to you about, I...

242
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,683
Kara, there's
an incident at the museum,

243
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:41,945
-can you get there?
-You know what, Lena?

244
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:44,339
I'm so sorry, a huge source

245
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,820
for one of my articles
is trying to meet,

246
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:49,605
he's impossible to pin down,
I got... I have to run.

247
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,824
-I'm sorry.
-I'll just see you tomorrow

248
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,956
-at the Pulitzer party.
-Right, yeah.

249
00:11:02,618 --> 00:11:04,272
Well, this is
new and terrible.

250
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:12,062
Where's an asteroid
when you need one?

251
00:11:23,334 --> 00:11:24,161
Ew.

252
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,947
Alex said
you might need my help.

253
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,078
Let's get the dino.

254
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:36,696
J'onn, J'onn,
hey, hey.

255
00:11:37,044 --> 00:11:37,914
Can you hear me?

256
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,796
I've never experienced
anything like it.

257
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,929
That T. rexmust've caused
some kind of psychic paralysis.

258
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,975
Any intel on
the dinosaur?

259
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,367
A shapeshifter.

260
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,326
-White Martian?
-No, I would've known.

261
00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:01,503
I'm guessing this alien
didn't want just another ride.

262
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,593
Kryptonian pods
use antimatter

263
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:05,725
to propel them through space,

264
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:07,901
and I know it's
a long shot, but...

265
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:09,641
can the engine be used...

266
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:10,991
To make a bomb?

267
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:14,168
It would require
great skill

268
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,128
and enormous resources.
But it is possible.

269
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:19,695
-How destructive?
-Strong enough to destroy

270
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,958
all life across
three solar systems.

271
00:12:22,002 --> 00:12:22,872
Oh, well...

272
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,266
We face
an even graver problem,

273
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,660
Supergirl's cape
has been destroyed.

274
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,011
Oh, yes, uh...

275
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,664
I totally forgot about
the risk to life

276
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,144
across three solar systems.

277
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,842
This is no time
for sarcasm,

278
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,887
however dry
or well-crafted.

279
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,586
Supergirl's cape
is uniquely suited
for the needs

280
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,066
of high-speed
superhero maneuvers.

281
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,547
And believe me,
when a Farfarmniflatch

282
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,463
is pursuing you across
the poisonous prison pits
of Takron-Galtos,

283
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:50,073
you will wish
for those heady days of old

284
00:12:50,117 --> 00:12:52,336
when your cape
allowed you for
an easy sharp right turn.

285
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,381
Oh, yes.

286
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,036
I...

287
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,733
I shall repair your cape.

288
00:12:58,255 --> 00:13:01,737
And we will forget
this sartorial disaster
ever occurred.

289
00:13:02,172 --> 00:13:03,695
We'll get whoever's
behind this.

290
00:13:08,091 --> 00:13:10,528
My father runs
Obsidian headquarters
in Buenos Aires.

291
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,966
He's consumed with
the space colonization rivalry

292
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,358
with Uncle Elon.

293
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,839
-Musk?
-Mmm-hmm.
Which works in my favor

294
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,362
because Dad turned the entire

295
00:13:18,406 --> 00:13:21,365
virtual and augmented
reality business over to me.

296
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:25,021
This is our VR gym,
where our VIP customers

297
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,807
can scale El Capitan
from the safety
of our office.

298
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:30,505
Or if they're like me,
they can do a couple

299
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:33,073
of half-baked crunches
on the Sao Paulo beach...

300
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:35,031
-...while scrolling
through Instagram

301
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,119
on their phones.

302
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,078
Here's our new medical wing.

303
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:42,865
I am so excited
for this opportunity,
Ms. Rojas.

304
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:44,127
As you should be.

305
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,826
This is a special moment
in time.

306
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,741
I'm determined
to have Obsidian tech
in every household

307
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:50,830
within the year.

308
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,267
Well, my worlds
are colliding.

309
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,183
-Lena.
-I see you have a good eye
for staffing.

310
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,446
Well, you know I only
do business with the best.

311
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,013
Are you enjoying
the contacts I gave you?

312
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,189
Could we talk privately?

313
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,584
-We had a deal.
-That's right.

314
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:11,111
CatCo Worldwide Media
for $1.3 billion.

315
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,287
A little more than my board
thought it was worth,

316
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,550
but I'm a softie
for an old friend in need.

317
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:18,814
I'm talking about the deal
to keep the CatCo sale
secret until tomorrow.

318
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:20,860
Instead you're upstairs
measuring the drapes.

319
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:23,819
Well, I'm sorry
I ruffled your feathers.

320
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,821
I didn't think a few hours
would make a difference.

321
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:26,866
Look...

322
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,869
I want us to start off
on the right foot here.

323
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:32,741
CatCo isn't the end all
of what we can offer
each other.

324
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,090
I agree.

325
00:14:34,134 --> 00:14:35,787
If we are to have
a relationship again,

326
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,616
and I ask you not to disclose
something for 24 hours,

327
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,401
I expect you to
take me at my word.

328
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:43,143
Everything I do
has a purpose.

329
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,537
-Understood.
-Just no more surprises.

330
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,975
And that big story
you promised me,

331
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,107
the one that would draw
every eyeball in the world

332
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,456
to CatCo's website?

333
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,676
So long your hands
were kept clean of it.

334
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,462
You'll get it tomorrow night
at 9:00 p.m. as promised.

335
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:00,682
I keep my word.

336
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:34,194
This room,
look at this room.

337
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,414
It's practically
overflowing with talent.

338
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:40,287
Journalism's
best and brightest.

339
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,028
And tomorrow,
we'll be joined by

340
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:43,507
the renowned William Day.

341
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,379
-From The Timesof London?
-Yes.

342
00:15:46,293 --> 00:15:48,948
Because as stacked
as we are already,

343
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:51,341
we can always be bigger.

344
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,214
We can always be stronger.
We can always be better.

345
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:55,911
And together,

346
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,132
we're gonna create
a world-class news
organization

347
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,874
that drives consumer
cross-platform engagement.

348
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,572
I'm sorry, uh...

349
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:06,922
-consumer cross-platform...
-Engagement.

350
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,272
Eyeballs, revenue,

351
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,449
we're gonna take your
already-brilliant work

352
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,712
and we are gonna sharpen it
until it's deadly,

353
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,236
and we're gonna monetize it.

354
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:17,889
With all due respect,
Ms. Rojas,

355
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,021
we don't allow revenue

356
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,023
to drive
editorial decisions here.

357
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,198
And it shows.

358
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,897
You've been running
the ship, James.

359
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,160
How's subscribership?

360
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,901
It's down.

361
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,077
Who wants that?

362
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,775
When Ms. Danvers
won the Pulitzer,

363
00:16:33,818 --> 00:16:35,211
readership tanked.

364
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:38,519
It gives a certain kind
of impression that

365
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,434
the paper is pedantic,

366
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:43,176
it's heavy, it's dull,
like homework.

367
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,220
That's insane.

368
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,179
No, Kara...

369
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,573
what's insane is
branding a company

370
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,880
in a way that causes
people to click away
from the site.

371
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,795
The news is not
about clicks.

372
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,624
Everything is about clicks.

373
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,758
From Fortune 500 companies
selling their wares

374
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:03,935
to a new mom
posting her child's birthday,

375
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:08,114
today the measure
of worth is on a click.

376
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:11,247
To survive,
CatCo needs to pivot.

377
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,382
Attention spans
have plummeted along
with revenues.

378
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:19,299
Readers want
watercooler news

379
00:17:19,342 --> 00:17:21,866
that's just fun to read
and just as easy to digest.

380
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,607
That, um...

381
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,480
I'm pretty sure I can speak
for everybody in the room

382
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:29,483
when I say that
if that is the kind of content

383
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:31,050
that you wanna
create here,

384
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:32,790
we will walk.

385
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,184
This is not what
we signed up for.

386
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,666
But it literally is.

387
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:44,759
You're all on a brand-new,
three-year contract.

388
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,329
If you're not interested
in helping me drive
CatCo into the future,

389
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,854
you are more than welcome
to side roll out of the car,

390
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,204
just as I am welcome

391
00:17:55,248 --> 00:17:57,119
to exercise
your non-compete clauses.

392
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,469
I'd hate to see such talent

393
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,210
be driven permanently
from the business.

394
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,038
But if your heart
isn't in it,

395
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:05,562
let me know.

396
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:07,912
Well, that's it.

397
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:10,959
Cheers to the future.

398
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:16,443
Kara, we found
Superman's pod.

399
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,536
Jeez.

400
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,842
You were right, Brainy,
this cape damage

401
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,540
is terrible
for aerodynamics.

402
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,368
I keep keeling over
to the right,

403
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,065
I almost landed
in a lake.

404
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,112
Well, fear not,
I am deeply engaged
in finding a solution.

405
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,462
And yet, that is
the least of our problems.

406
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,334
The DEO just picked up
a massive energy signature,

407
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:39,553
and it's not a bomb
like we thought.

408
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,989
It's a homemade
Phantom Zone projector.

409
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,165
Whoever built this
seems to have been

410
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,689
stealing rare, high-security
materials for weeks

411
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,562
from various armories,
laboratories, and
government agencies.

412
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,780
But not from us.

413
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:52,566
The pod's antimatter
engine was the final
piece of the puzzle.

414
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,743
So they've spent weeks
building a Phantom Zone
projector,

415
00:18:55,786 --> 00:18:57,353
turned it on,

416
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:58,876
and just left it
on the ground?

417
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,574
It's almost as if
they wanted us to find it.

418
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:02,619
Only question is, why?

419
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,534
Trap.

420
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,287
There is no hiding
from Midnight...

421
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:21,203
-...murderer of multitudes.

422
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,770
I'm Kara Zor-El.

423
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:26,295
My mother put many prisoners
in the Phantom Zone,

424
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,123
I assume you're here
for me.

425
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:30,256
But don't take your fury out
on this planet

426
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:31,692
just because
she locked you up.

427
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:33,650
Your mother
didn't lock her up.

428
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:37,959
-I did.
- J'onn J'onzz.

429
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,626
Those
are energy voids.

430
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,323
They destroy
everything they touch.

431
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:55,759
Can you phase
through them?

432
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,152
I'll try.

433
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,299
Supergirl, the projector.

434
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:34,145
She's gone.

435
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,886
She'll be back.

436
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,196
No one knows
who Midnight is.

437
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,719
What planet she's from.

438
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:45,331
One day she just
appeared on Mars

439
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:47,115
to fight alongside
the White Martians.

440
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,900
-But why?
-Because she's fueled by death.

441
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,861
And the White Martians
were quite happy to let her
loose on my people.

442
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:55,950
How did you
defeat her?

443
00:20:56,777 --> 00:20:58,082
I can't remember.

444
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,867
You're still recovering from
the psychic trauma

445
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,477
you experienced
at the museum.

446
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:03,087
It could affect your memory.

447
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,872
This feels personal, J'onn.

448
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,177
Manchester Black spent a year

449
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,092
launching personal attacks
against me.

450
00:21:08,571 --> 00:21:10,530
If I can survive him,
I can survive anything.

451
00:21:10,573 --> 00:21:12,096
We still have to
find Midnight.

452
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,968
And we don't know
who brought her here
or why.

453
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:17,058
The good news is, a battle
like that must have
depleted her powers.

454
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,147
I think we bought ourselves
up to 24 hours

455
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,453
before she's able
to attack again.

456
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:22,281
Well, good, I'll circle
the country

457
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:23,717
and see if I can find her
while she's still weak.

458
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:26,546
J'onn, can you shapeshift
and accept my award tonight?

459
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:27,677
Oh, yes, please,

460
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,288
it's great fun
to watch you do that.

461
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,290
Kara, no.

462
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,422
You are accepting
that award.

463
00:21:33,466 --> 00:21:35,250
And we're all gonna be
there to watch.

464
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,078
We'll find Midnight,
and we're gonna face her

465
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:39,428
the same exact way
that we face everything else.

466
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,082
Together.

467
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,434
This is nice,
you in my office.

468
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:48,263
Well, I'm not so sure
if I actually have
an office anymore.

469
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,353
Yeah, I ran into Kara
in the elevator,

470
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,573
and I had to tell her
I couldn't join her crusade

471
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,791
against my new boss

472
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:57,403
on my second day.

473
00:21:57,446 --> 00:21:58,708
Yeah.

474
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,580
I'll support whatever you guys
decide to do.

475
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:03,365
Just mostly in the abstract.

476
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,498
I'm just really proud
of the company

477
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,064
that we built over
the last few years.

478
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:10,764
It's a strong, serious,
hard-hitting news organization

479
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:12,026
that actually
affects people's lives.

480
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,942
Whatever this vision
Andrea has for CatCo,

481
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,335
I don't recognize it.

482
00:22:16,813 --> 00:22:18,424
And I don't think
I can play that game.

483
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:19,816
Then don't.

484
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,688
What do you mean?

485
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:23,820
CatCo and journalism
isn't all that you are.

486
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:26,127
You started helping people

487
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,390
long before Dad put that
camera in your hand.

488
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:32,394
And look, I know that
you think that you have to

489
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:34,483
muscle your way
through everything.

490
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:39,488
But, for once,
just take a step back

491
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:40,750
and ask...

492
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,711
"What does James Olsen want?"

493
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:49,498
-You wanted to see me?
-Kara.

494
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,022
I believe you're familiar
with William Day.

495
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:54,547
Yes. Yes.

496
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,852
Uh, by reputation.

497
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:57,898
I'm a big fan
of your work.

498
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,857
Your expose
on eminent domain

499
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,077
in Hart-el-pool,
it was brilliant.

500
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,166
It's Hartlepool.

501
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,474
I totally agree.

502
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:10,127
Solar window treatments
are the way to go.

503
00:23:10,171 --> 00:23:13,261
Kara, I asked William
to take a look at
the few articles

504
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:14,958
James said
we're ready to post.

505
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,571
Your piece on
the governor's proposed
water tax

506
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,529
is very thoroughly
researched.

507
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,183
I asked William
to rewrite it.

508
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:25,491
You buried the lede
in the fourth paragraph,

509
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:28,407
obscured emotion
with unneeded facts
and back story.

510
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,713
Overloaded it
with unnecessary detail.

511
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:36,415
That story laid out
everything going on
with the issue.

512
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,635
Cutting out facts,
not disclosing every side,

513
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,029
that puts inherent bias
in the piece.

514
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,161
Every story has inherent bias,
to some extent.

515
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,512
I would think you

516
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,122
of all people
would agree with me.

517
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:51,212
Your reporting is comprehensive
and in-depth.

518
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:52,822
When I wrote for The Times,

519
00:23:52,866 --> 00:23:54,476
I wrote stories the way
The Timeswanted them.

520
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:58,915
Did the same for Le Monde,
in French no less.
The Mail,however,

521
00:23:59,568 --> 00:24:01,222
-I wrote tabloid stock.
- Kara,

522
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:05,531
if you're having trouble
with the style I'm looking for,

523
00:24:05,574 --> 00:24:07,489
William can always
rewrite you.

524
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,709
-I don't mind, as long
as I get a shared byline.
-Of course.

525
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,542
You can't just take over
a storied news outlet

526
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:19,283
and turn it into
a pandering clickbait tabloid.

527
00:24:19,762 --> 00:24:21,068
Actually, I can...

528
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,809
And here's where you
threaten me if I quit,

529
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,115
-you'll block me
from the whole profession.
-Correct.

530
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:26,465
-Mmm-hmm.
-And I'm not gonna fire you.

531
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,597
Well, I'm not leaving
journalism,

532
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,730
so if I stay here,
you should get used
to the fact

533
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,558
that I will be reporting
what I want

534
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,168
and writing it
the way I want to.

535
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,997
I will try to be shorter,
because I am flexible.

536
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,825
But I will fight you

537
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:41,262
every time on every story

538
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,917
to make sure it is told
the way it deserves to be told.

539
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,267
I will not tolerate
being rewritten by him,

540
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,312
and I will not allow
my voice to be silenced.

541
00:24:49,226 --> 00:24:52,403
I never had any intention
of silencing you, Kara.

542
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,929
-I'm glad we worked that out.
-Good for me.

543
00:24:57,234 --> 00:24:58,235
Good.

544
00:25:12,815 --> 00:25:14,730
And then I just went off
on Andrea.

545
00:25:14,774 --> 00:25:16,297
I told her how I really feel

546
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,604
about her new vision
for CatCo,

547
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,780
and I told her what
I will and will not tolerate,

548
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:22,477
and I did it
all in front of the new guy.

549
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,523
-Good for you.

550
00:25:25,001 --> 00:25:27,700
Yeah, I mean,
I can stand up in front
of my new boss,

551
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:30,616
but with Lena, when it comes
to telling her the truth,

552
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:31,965
I'm just frozen.

553
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:33,793
Why can't I do it?

554
00:25:33,836 --> 00:25:35,969
Look, I know
I've been hard on you.

555
00:25:36,012 --> 00:25:39,929
But you know what?
Tonight, this is your night.

556
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:45,369
So I am giving you permission
to stop beating yourself up

557
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:47,110
and enjoy it, okay?

558
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:48,895
You can worry about
telling Lena another time.

559
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,636
I guess you're right.

560
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,985
Smile.

561
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:53,987
-Hey.
-Hi.

562
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,163
-Hi.
-Congratulations, Kara.

563
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,992
-Thank you.
-Do you mind if I steal
your sister away for a dance?

564
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:00,863
No, of course.
She loves dancing.

565
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:03,562
-I am terrible.
-Excuse me.

566
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,216
Kara, I brought you a gift

567
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,654
to celebrate
this momentous occasion.

568
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:10,351
Oh, Brainy,
that is so sweet of you.

569
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:11,918
You didn't have to do that.

570
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:12,875
I'm so excited.

571
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:14,224
Behold.

572
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:18,011
It's a microscopic
motion activator.

573
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,360
Oh, did you forget it?

574
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:22,842
It is simply too small
to be perceived,

575
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,104
but don't be fooled,

576
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:27,977
for this miniscule device
contains multitudes.

577
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:31,590
More specifically,
your new super suit.

578
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,114
Brainy, I thought you were
just fixing my cape.

579
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,898
Well, give an artist
a canvas,

580
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,466
if you'll allow me.

581
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,816
Well, um, can I...
Don't break them.

582
00:26:43,471 --> 00:26:45,865
Now, please take care

583
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,736
when removing
your glasses in public,

584
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,043
for the next time
you whip those off,

585
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,436
your new suit
will materialize.

586
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,656
Or dematerialize,
as needed.

587
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,633
Lena.

588
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:16,896
What are you doing
back here?

589
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:18,941
Okay, you caught me.

590
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:20,900
It was supposed
to be a surprise,

591
00:27:20,943 --> 00:27:22,249
but I'm the one
who's gonna introduce you.

592
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,425
I couldn't miss
an opportunity

593
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,079
to tell the world
how wonderful you are.

594
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,733
No, no, I...

595
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:30,039
Lena, I can't let you do this,

596
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:32,215
-I don't deserve it.
-Are you kidding me?

597
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,914
Me more than anyone knows
how much you deserve it.

598
00:27:35,305 --> 00:27:37,960
I saw how you risked
your life to expose
Lex's crimes.

599
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:39,266
I'm Supergirl.

600
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,282
I've always been Supergirl.

601
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:00,635
I should've told you
so long ago, I know that.

602
00:28:01,244 --> 00:28:02,811
But I just kept making excuses

603
00:28:02,855 --> 00:28:04,726
because you've been hurt
so many times

604
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:05,771
and...

605
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:10,210
I convinced myself
that I was protecting you.

606
00:28:12,168 --> 00:28:14,823
And then one day,
you were so angry with me,

607
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,477
with Supergirl.

608
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:18,697
But you still loved Kara.

609
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:22,048
I just kept thinking...

610
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,616
if I could be Kara,
just Kara...

611
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:29,359
that I could keep you
as a friend.

612
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:34,887
I was selfish
and scared,

613
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:37,280
and I didn't wanna lose you,

614
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,196
so I kept pretending,

615
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,330
and I never stopped.

616
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:48,988
Every time I kept my secret
from you, I wasn't...

617
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,468
protecting you,
I was hurting you,

618
00:28:51,512 --> 00:28:55,690
just like everyone else,
and I am so, so sorry.

619
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,781
I am so sorry.

620
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:06,440
Please say something.

621
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,444
Ms. Luthor, you're on
in two minutes.

622
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:13,273
Lena...

623
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:30,769
Okay.

624
00:29:41,562 --> 00:29:44,130
Ms. Luthor,
it's almost 9:00 p.m.

625
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:47,263
Should I upload
the file to CatCo's servers?

626
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,363
Ms. Luthor?

627
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,454
The world is full of liars.

628
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:07,893
People who hide things
from us.

629
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,331
People who manipulate
and control us.

630
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,811
I should know.

631
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:15,074
Some of the best liars
in the world

632
00:30:15,117 --> 00:30:15,901
are members of
my own family.

633
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:17,946
But in my life,

634
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,470
there was someone
who always reminded me

635
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:21,863
that truth was
the better way.

636
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,780
And she is the person
we are here tonight
to celebrate.

637
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,000
Kara Danvers.

638
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,397
The truth isn't easy.

639
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:36,486
It's certainly not
for the faint of heart.

640
00:30:36,965 --> 00:30:39,359
But it is something
that Kara, as a journalist,

641
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,101
has pursued relentlessly
every day.

642
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,973
And because she's
so good at it,

643
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,106
she makes it look easy.

644
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,109
We sometimes forget
that she's just like us.

645
00:30:51,937 --> 00:30:54,113
But forging a path to the truth

646
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:55,854
isn't a piece of cake.

647
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,421
It's more like
climbing a mountain.

648
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:01,555
It's arduous
and painful at times,

649
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,861
and, just like us,

650
00:31:03,992 --> 00:31:05,602
Kara can sometimes slip.

651
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:09,215
But she always
gets back up

652
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,869
and pulls through
in the end.

653
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:15,351
And we're always
better for her efforts.

654
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,920
So, thank you, Kara,
for reminding us

655
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:20,617
that the truth
is important.

656
00:31:21,183 --> 00:31:23,359
Even when it's not
always easy to accept.

657
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,715
Agent Dox,
we have an update.

658
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,589
Kara.

659
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:38,026
You will always
be my best friend.

660
00:31:39,549 --> 00:31:41,725
I just received
an alert from the DEO.

661
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,293
Midnight is fully charged
and on the move.

662
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,295
-Where is she?
- Here.

663
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,569
J'onn, lead her
away from the civilians.

664
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,657
We'll follow.

665
00:32:08,752 --> 00:32:10,015
I guess
that's your cue.

666
00:32:10,276 --> 00:32:11,146
Supergirl.

667
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,386
Pants.

668
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:51,186
How do you guys
change so fast?

669
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:11,119
Well, that's not great.

670
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:29,833
What is she doing?

671
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:31,792
She's creating
a black hole.

672
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,360
Brainy, if I solar flare,

673
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:36,449
can I shut that down?

674
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,494
Gravitational power
comes from the core.

675
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,323
We'd have to go inside
the void to do that.

676
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,804
But why do things the hard way?

677
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:44,761
J'onn.

678
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,078
J'onn!

679
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:07,915
Guess we're doing things
the hard way.

680
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:10,396
No, no, no, you cannot
rescue J'onn from
the event horizon

681
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:11,832
and destroy the void.

682
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:13,486
The odds are--

683
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:15,270
We can't let bad odds
or whatever it is
we're afraid of

684
00:34:15,314 --> 00:34:17,272
stop us from doing
what we know is right.

685
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:29,154
Supergirl, no.

686
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,504
We shouldn't both
die in here.

687
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:32,809
We won't.

688
00:34:52,655 --> 00:34:54,657
See?

689
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,050
Piece of cake.

690
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:13,328
And you're sure
the server didn't go down?

691
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,940
Because I was waiting on
a file that didn't come in.

692
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:18,986
Well, check it again.

693
00:35:21,597 --> 00:35:23,121
Thought you were
supposed to be the tech expert.

694
00:35:24,426 --> 00:35:25,427
There you are.

695
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,560
You were at the party

696
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:29,649
when that big, weird hole
opened, no?

697
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,521
Where are the photos?

698
00:35:32,565 --> 00:35:34,915
I believe Dardine
at extension 506
has what you need.

699
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:36,743
I got nothing.

700
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:39,354
Now, I can go into
a whole diatribe

701
00:35:39,398 --> 00:35:41,878
about why that is,
but I know you like
to keep things

702
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:43,228
short and sweet, so...

703
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:45,621
I quit.

704
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:48,407
Are you sure
about that?

705
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,582
Mmm-hmm.

706
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:51,671
You'll never work
as a journalist again.

707
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:54,804
That's part of
the adventure.

708
00:35:58,025 --> 00:35:59,896
Okay, no, Kelly,

709
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,421
-you need to settle something
for us once and for all.
- Mmm.

710
00:36:02,464 --> 00:36:04,684
Who is the greatest
movie villain of all time?

711
00:36:04,727 --> 00:36:06,381
Oh, that's easy.

712
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:07,687
Hans Gruber.

713
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:10,298
-Oh, my heart.
-What...

714
00:36:11,995 --> 00:36:13,301
Yes. Told you.

715
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:14,781
-Mmm.

716
00:36:14,824 --> 00:36:15,912
-Bye, guys.
-Bye.

717
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,175
See you tomorrow.

718
00:36:20,482 --> 00:36:21,614
Uh...

719
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:23,050
Okay.

720
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:27,185
We need to
talk about this.

721
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:36,281
We've been together
or something like together

722
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:37,804
for almost a month.

723
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:39,893
-Almost.
-And...

724
00:36:40,502 --> 00:36:43,810
we still never get past
a firm handshake.

725
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,160
I...

726
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:48,554
I just need to know
what you're comfortable with.

727
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:53,689
Because I get the feeling
that maybe you haven't...

728
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,430
done this before.

729
00:36:55,735 --> 00:36:57,954
Which is fine
if you haven't,

730
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,739
-I totally understand that...
-You thought that...

731
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:02,132
-Are you?
-No.

732
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,527
-Oh.
-I've had plenty of
romantic experience.

733
00:37:05,571 --> 00:37:08,487
-I mean, a lot, actually.
-Oh, okay.

734
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:09,749
Truth is...

735
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,972
you are the first person
I have ever loved.

736
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:19,324
-Brainy.
-You want to know why

737
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,717
I find Miranda Priestly
so terrifying?

738
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,589
It's because she's cold,

739
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,243
she's uncaring,

740
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,246
she betrays the people
she cares about the most.

741
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,901
And last month
at Lex Luthor's camp,

742
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,254
that is exactly how
I behaved toward you.

743
00:37:36,558 --> 00:37:38,560
-Brainy.
-Even though I love you,

744
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:39,909
I hurt you.

745
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:43,522
If I've kept my distance,
it's because I find myself

746
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:46,307
wondering how could
I ever let my guard down

747
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,657
-with you again, I...
-Querl Dox,

748
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,703
I know you.

749
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,316
That person who left me
at the camp wasn't you.

750
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:59,277
You are caring,

751
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,322
and selfless,

752
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,585
and good.

753
00:38:07,241 --> 00:38:09,939
I want to be the person
you let your guard down with.

754
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,465
I want you to be able to...

755
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,423
fully be yourself with me.

756
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,339
Do you want that too?

757
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:21,211
More than anything.

758
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:24,780
Then kiss me?

759
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,800
Uh...

760
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:46,846
Are you lost?

761
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:52,547
No, J'onn J'onzz.

762
00:38:52,591 --> 00:38:54,332
I'm exactly
where I should be.

763
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,731
You're the shapeshifter
that released Midnight.

764
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:04,646
What do you want from me?

765
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:07,127
To be punished
for your crimes.

766
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,782
You may have defeated
Midnight, but I'll make sure

767
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,610
you get what you deserve.

768
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:13,133
Why? Who are you?

769
00:39:13,176 --> 00:39:16,136
Don't pretend
you don't recognize me.

770
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,181
Brother.

771
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:23,839
I have no brother.

772
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:25,188
Lies.

773
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,669
You and Father are more evil
than even I knew,

774
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,193
but justice will prevail.

775
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:32,631
I will do to you
as you did to me.

776
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,372
You say you're
my brother...

777
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,070
Prove it!

778
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,746
Lena, I can't tell you
how much it means to me

779
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,095
that you were there tonight,

780
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,489
that you're even willing
to talk to me at all.

781
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:07,666
Thank you for telling me
the truth,

782
00:40:07,709 --> 00:40:08,580
but, Kara,

783
00:40:09,842 --> 00:40:11,713
things can't be like
they were before.

784
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:15,674
Do you understand?
There can be no more
secrets between us,

785
00:40:15,717 --> 00:40:17,415
-I have to be in
on everything.
-You will be.

786
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,418
That's actually
why I'm here.

787
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,290
You know everything now.

788
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:34,693
And if you ever need me,

789
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:36,912
all you have to do is call.

790
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:51,100
The file
was ready to upload.

791
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:52,711
Why didn't you send it,

792
00:40:52,754 --> 00:40:55,409
exposing Supergirl's
identity to the world?

793
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,280
Did you forgive
Kara Danvers?

794
00:40:57,324 --> 00:40:58,456
She betrayed me.

795
00:40:59,935 --> 00:41:01,154
It broke my heart.

796
00:41:02,851 --> 00:41:04,287
I could never forgive her.

797
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,246
- Then I don't
understand.
-How could you?

798
00:41:06,289 --> 00:41:07,465
You're not a Luthor.

799
00:41:07,856 --> 00:41:09,162
We're scorpions.

800
00:41:09,554 --> 00:41:11,077
When someone betrays us,
we sting.

801
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:14,472
But I have a calling, Hope,

802
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:16,430
and it's to fix mankind.

803
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:19,389
I never thought Supergirl
would tell me who she was,

804
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:22,044
but now that she has,
I have an opportunity,

805
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,656
and I can use Supergirl
to achieve my ends.

806
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,963
That is easier to do
if she believes
there is trust.

807
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,359
Load the simulation.

808
00:41:32,794 --> 00:41:34,317
Yes, Ms. Luthor.

809
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:38,583
Good night.
